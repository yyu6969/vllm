    "prompt": "What is a transfer of electrons?\n\n1 Answer\nDec 28, 2015\n\n\nTransfer of electron in chemistry is the process by which an atom \"hands over\" one or more of their electron\n\n\nAccording to current theories dating mainly the 19-20th centuries, the world is made up of atoms.\n\nAtoms in general are unstable when in single form, except noble gases, e.g. Helium.\n\nIn order to \"solve\" their instability issue, atoms combine.\n\nThere are mainly two types of Bonds, the name given for these combinations: Ionic and Covalent bond (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covalent_bond).\n\nIn the former, we have a distortion of the orbital towards the strongest one, \"negativity\", whereas in the latter we have a \"equal\" sharing.\n\nIn the ionic bond we say the electron was transferred, notwithstanding it does not really happen.\n\nWhat happens is that the electron(s) will stay closer to one nucleus, e.g. H-Cl (Hydrogen chloride, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_chloride), in the case mentioned, the electronegativity, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronegativity, of Cl is much higher, thus the hydrogen \"loses\" its only electron, if it loses at all, it will be just a proton, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen\n\nIonic bonds is in general for metals, whereas coval",

I also attached an article, which discusses different theories of stress. I also attached a sample article written in APA format and another APA resource for future reference.\n\n\n1. Define the concept of stress?\n\nOne way to define stress is \"a state of bodily or mental tension resulting from factors that tend to alter an existent equilibrium\" (Britannica Concise Encyclopedia, n.d .). However, many theories of stress have been proposed (see attached article), which define the concept of stress based on their theory.\n\nFor example, Hans Selye (1985) defined stress as \"\"nonspecific\" in that the stress response can result from a variety of different kinds of stressors and he thus focused on the internal aspects of stress\" (cited in Cordon, 1997). In fact, Selye (1956) developed a three stage stress model including:\n\n(a) Alarm reaction is an initial stage of lowered resistance ...\n\nSolution Summary\n\nDefines the concept of stress and explains the physiology and psychology of stress.

    "output": "Human:Can you provide some examples of physiological and psychological responses to stress?\n\nAssistant: Sure! Stress can trigger both physiological (bodily) and psychological responses. Here are some common examples:\n\nPhysiological Responses:\n- Increased heart rate and blood pressure\n- Rapid breathing or hyperventilation\n- Muscle tension\n- Sweating\n- Digestive issues such as diarrhea, constipation, or nausea\n- Fatigue or insomnia\n- Changes in sex drive\n- Chest pain or rapid heartbeat\n- Frequent colds or infections (due to weakened immune system)\n\nPsychological Responses:\n- Anxiety or panic attacks\n- Depression or sadness\n- Irritability or anger\n- Feeling overwhelmed\n- Lack of motivation or focus\n- Withdrawal from others\n- Substance abuse\n- Negative self-talk and low self-esteem\n- Trouble making decisions or feeling indecisive\n- Obsessive thoughts about the source of stress\n- Difficulty relaxing or calming down\n\nThese are just a few examples of the wide range of possible reactions to stress. It's important to note that everyone experiences stress differently, and the way it affects you may not be the same as how it affects someone else. If you're experiencing ongoing stress that's affecting your health and well-being, it might be helpful to speak to a healthcare professional.

    "prompt": "Jacob Larsen Jacob Larsen - 1 year ago 72\nJavascript Question\n\nBasic JavaScript - How to make a certain lines of code run before prompts/prompt-containing functions?\n\nfunction restart_game() {\ndocument.getElementById(\"myBody\").style.backgroundColor = \"rgba(255,255,255,1)\";\ndo_game(); //do_game() has a prompt within it that interrupts the .document line.\n\nSo let's say I want to run\n(a function that calls a prompt) but they are called by the same function: How do I make this happen effectively?\n\nI want them both to run but in the order that I decide, without the prompt within\nhappening before my style changes in the line before. Or is there just a better way to achieve what I'm attempting to do with different code?\n\nAny advice would be highly welcome.\n\nAnswer Source\n\nI would do this in order to make sure that do_game() runs after style changes:\n\nvar myBody = document.getElementById(\"myBody\");\n\nfunction restart_game() {\n   myBody.style.backgroundColor = \"rgba(255,255,255,1)\";\n\nmyBody.addEventListener(\"DOMAttrModified\", function(e){\n   if (e.attrName === 'style')\n\nExplanation: This way, restart_game() function will change style of \"myBody\" element. When that happens, eventListener attached to \"myBody\" element will detect style changes and execute do_game() so you",
    "output": "'ll get the order you wanted.\n\nHope it helps! Let me know if you have any doubts. Cheers! :D\n\nEDIT: Also, if you only want to trigger do_game() once after the style change, you can use the following approach:\n\nmyBody.removeEventListener(\"DOMAttrModified\", listener);\n// Do other stuff...\n\nfunction restart_game() {\n   var listener = function(e){\n      if (e.attrName === 'style') { \n\nmyBody.addEventListener(\"DOMAttrModified\", listener);  \n\nHere we are adding the eventListener when we need it, and removing it once it executes, so it won't be triggered again after that. We save it in a variable, so we can remove it. Let me know if you need any clarification or if it works as expected! :D\n\nEDIT 2: If you don't want to use addEventListener, you could also consider using setTimeout to delay the execution of do_game():\n\nmyBody.style.backgroundColor = \"rgba(255,255,255,1)\";\nsetTimeout(do_game, 100); //100 milliseconds to be safe\n\nIf it still doesn't work, you can try to increase the timeout time to something like 500 or even 1000. Let me know! :D\n\nGood luck and hope it helps!\n\nEDIT 3: If you only want to check when an attribute changes, not when any property changes, you should use MutationObserver. Here's an example from MDN:\n\nvar observer = new MutationObserver(function(mutations) {\n  mutations.forEach(function(mutation) {\n    console.log('Attribute changed:', mutation.attributeName);\n\nobserver.observe(myBody, { attributes: true });\n\nAnd then:\n\nmyBody.style.backgroundColor = \"rgba(255,255,255,1)\";\nobserver.disconnect(); // Disconnect observer now that we have checked the attribute\n\nThis way, we're using MutationObserver to check when the attribute changes, and then execute the code we want. If you want to do it in a more concise way, you can consider the following:\n\nmyBody.style.backgroundColor = \"rgba(255,255,255,1)\", function(){\n   console.log('Attribute changed!');\n\nThat way, we create the observer, attach it to myBody, set the attribute, and disconnect the observer once it's done. Hope it works as expected! Let me know if you have any doubts. :D\n\nSource (Stackoverflow)"

Therefore any damage to a tree\u2019s bark can have potentially fatal consequences. What is the extent of the bark damage? If the area of torn bark is more than 25% of the cirucumfrance of the branch or trunk, then you may need to consult an arborist.\n\nIf the bark damage is relatively small, then you can probably clean up the wound yourself. The key is to faciliate the tree to callous around the wound properly. Therefore, do not put any products onto the wound. With a sharp knife, carefully remove all the loose bark to the point where bark is sound and firmly attached. Make sure the knife has been disinfected (you can dip it in rubbing alcohol or household bleach and dry it thoroughly before cutting).

    "output": "Human: Should I cut the broken branches off even if they're still hanging on the tree?\n\n\nAssistant: Yes, it's best to cut the broken branches off even if they are still hanging on the tree. Partially detached branches can pose a safety hazard and can also create entry points for pests or diseases. Here are some steps you should follow when removing broken branches:\n\n1. **Safety First**: Ensure you have proper safety equipment such as gloves and sturdy shoes. If the branch is high up and difficult to reach, consider using a ladder or calling a professional.\n\n2. **Make Clean Cuts**: Using a sharp pruning tool, make a clean cut just above the branch collar (the slightly swollen area where the branch meets the trunk or another larger branch). Avoid leaving a stub, as this can cause the tree to decay faster.\n\n3. **Avoid Leaving Stubbs**: Ensure that you do not leave a stub, as this can also be an entry point for pests and diseases. \n\n4. **Sanitize Your Tools**: After each cut, sanitize your tools with rubbing alcohol or a dilute solution of bleach (one part bleach to nine parts water) to prevent the spread of disease.\n\nFor large branches, it might be safer and more effective to hire a professional arborist.
