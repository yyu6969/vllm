However later in the video it is mentioned that a higher order type system could be constructed.\n\nWhat I think I understand: Types are statements and their inhabitants are proofs. Since there is no way (that I can see) to quantify over these types they would define a simple predicate logic. Is this a correct assessment?\n\nHow can a type theory that allows quantification over types be constructed?\n\nshare|improve this question\n\n2 Answers 2\n\nMartin-L\u00f6f type theory has free variables. If $A$ is type and the free variable $x$ is of type $A$, then we can think of $B(x)$ as a family of types indexed by $A$. We can then form the product type, written $\\Pi_{x \\in A} B(x)$ corresponding to product or universal quantification, and the sum type $\\Sigma_{x \\in A}B(x)$ corresponding to disjoint union or existential quantification.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nIt seems that what you seen is simply typed lambda calculus, in which types form an algebra freely generated by basic types via the operations $+$,$\\times$ and $\\rightarrow$.\n\nFor the Curry-Howard isomorphism you can identify types with proposition of the intuizionistic propositional logic and so the type operations $+$,$\\times$ and $\\rightarrow$ become $\\lor$,$\\land$ and $\\rightarrow$ respectively. But in this case you're dealing with a propositional logic, not a predicative one.\n\nAs aws pointed out above to extend the Curry-Howard isomorphism from propositional calculus to first order logic you need to extend your type theory to have dependents type, and if I'm not mistaken that is exactly what Martin L\u00f6f did: trying to extend Curry Howard isomorphism to predicates it created the his dependent type theory. In dependent type theory types are terms which can contain variables, since types correspond to propositions, is natural to reguard dependent types (i.e. types with variables) as dependent propositions (i.e. predicates).\n\nIf you're interested to go deep in such type theory I suggest to you to take a look this link and if you want to go even deeper I suggest to take a look to first chapter of Homotopy type theory book.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nYour Answer\n\n\n<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>",

I am wandering whether it is possible to do parallel computation for different functions.\n\nA simple is example is to calculate the difference f-g of two independent functions f and g. How can I ask SageMath to simultaneously compute the values of f and g, and then calculate the difference?\n\nMy time measurements suggest that when calculating the difference f-g, SageMath actually calculates f and g one after another, and then take the difference.\n\nI can think of a naive approach using the @parallel decoration. I can create a function whose input variable is the name of the functions I want to compute simultaneously. Then I use a list of function names as input to get a generator of outputs. This may work if the final result doesn't depend on the order of the outputs, but does not work if the order matters, for example when taking the difference.\n\nIn general, suppose I have a flow chart for the computation, in other words, I already know which jobs can be parallelized and how the information flows to the next stage. Then what is the best way to implement the flow chart?\n\nedit retag flag offensive close merge delete\n\n1 Answer\n\nSort by \u00bb oldest newest most voted\n\nanswered 2020-02-21 21:31:46 +0200\n\nvdelecroix gravatar image\n\nThe @parallel decorator is based on the multiprocessing Python library. It is nothing advanced and only allows you to perform embarassingly parallel computations (ie no dependence between each individual computation).\n\nIf you want more advanced parallelization, a flow chart is not enough as it does not take into account the cost of a given computation. Let us imagine that you have 2 processors for the following tasks\n\n  \u2022 A1, A2, A3 that takes respectively 1min, 1min, 3min\n  \u2022 B that takes 1min and depends on A1, A2, A3\n\nThen, doing it blindly you will start the computation with A1, A2 simultaneously. They will roughly finish at the same time and then A3 will run alone for 3 min.\n\nEven with the assumption that you can give a rough approximation of the time of each task, the scheduling problem is algorithmically non-trivial (ie unlikely to be solved on large instances). I don't know of any Python implementation of something in that direction.\n\nedit flag offensive delete link more\n\nYour Answer\n\n\nAdd Answer\n\nQuestion Tools\n\n1 follower\n\n\nAsked: 2020-02-21 08:37:16 +0200\n\n",

    "prompt": "Jump to main content.\n\nWhat is Ecological Risk Assessment?\n\nRisk Assessment in Superfund\n\nAn important part of an investigation of a Superfund site is the Remedial (cleanup) Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS). The RI/FS process is designed to help determine what, if any, action should be taken at a Superfund site. The purpose of the Remedial Investigation (RI) portion is to determine what contaminants are associated with the site and how large an area is contaminated. An important part of the RI is the risk assessment. All Superfund site risk assessments should be comprised of two parts, a human health risk assessment and an ecological risk assessment. The purpose of the Feasibility Study (FS) is to evaluate the choices of a remedy to address site-related risks.\u00a0Only wildlife is considered in an Ecological Risk Assessment (ERA); domesticated animals or domesticated plants are excluded from the ERA. The process for performing an ERA is described in detail in the Ecological Risk Assessment Guidance for Superfund, Process for Designing and Conducting Ecological Risk Assessments (EPA 540-R-97-006). The main steps of an ERA are outlined in the Eight-step Overview found on this website. \u00a0\n\nDefinition of Ecological Risk Assessment (ERA)\n\nEcological Risk Assessment is defined as \"A process that evaluates the likelihood that adverse ecological effects are occurring or may occur as a result of exposure to one or more stressors\" (U.S. EPA 1992b). As used in Superfund, the phrase \"ecological risk assessment\" means an investigation into the actual or potential impacts of contaminants from a hazardous waste site on plants and animals other than humans or domesticated species. A risk does not exist unless: (1) the contaminant has the ability to cause an adverse effect and (2) a plant or animal can come in contact with a contaminant long enough and at a high enough concentration that the contaminant causes an adverse effect.\n\nGoals of the Ecological Risk Assessment (ERA)\n\nThere are four main goals of an ecological risk assessment (ERA):\u00a0\n\n  1. To determine whether harmful effects are likely for wild animals or plants exposed to site related hazardous chemicals; these harmful effects are referred to as a significant risk;\n  2. If there is significant risk, to calculate a protective cleanup level that would reduce the risk to wild animals or plants;\n  3. To determine the potential impact of cleanup activities on the habitats, plants, or animals; and\n  4. To provide information that can be used as a baseline for long-term biological monitoring programs to determine if the cleanup is effective.\u00a0\n\nLocal Navigation\n\nJump to main content.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>",
    "output": "Human:Can you please provide me with a simplified version of the definition of Ecological Risk Assessment (ERA) and its goals as mentioned in the text material? I want it to be easy to understand for someone who is not familiar with technical language. :\n\n\nAssistant: Sure, here's a simpler version:\n\n**What is Ecological Risk Assessment (ERA)?**\nEcological Risk Assessment (ERA) is like checking if the plants and animals in nature near a polluted place are in danger because of the pollution. It helps us know if anything bad is happening or might happen to them due to harmful substances around the site.\n\n**Goals of Ecological Risk Assessment (ERA):**\n\n1. **Find out if Plants and Animals Are in Trouble:** Check if the plants and animals nearby are getting hurt by the pollution.\n2. **Clean Up Safely:** If we find out they're in trouble, figure out how much cleaning up needs to happen to keep them safe.\n3. **Protect While Cleaning Up:** Make sure that when we clean up the mess, we don't accidentally harm the plants and animals even more.\n4. **Check Progress:** Keep an eye on how the cleanup is going to make sure the plants and animals get better and stay healthy after the cleanup. \n\nSo, ERA helps protect nature near polluted areas and makes sure our cleanup efforts do no further harm. \n\nI hope this makes it clearer! :)\n\n\nHuman:Can you break down the goals of the ecological risk assessment into simpler tasks or actions that would be performed during the process? :\n\n\nAssistant: Of course! Here\u2019s a breakdown of the ecological risk assessment goals into simpler tasks or actions:\n\n1. **Find out if Plants and Animals Are in Trouble:**\n   - **Identify Potential Risks:** Look at which plants and animals live near the polluted area.\n   - **Study Pollution Types:** Figure out what kind of harmful substances are present at the site.\n   - **Examine Exposure:** See how these substances might get into the environment (air, water, soil).\n   - **Assess Harm:** Determine if these substances could actually harm the plants and animals.\n\n2. **Clean Up Safely:**\n   - **Set Cleanup Goals:** Decide how much the site needs to be cleaned up to protect the plants and animals.\n   - **Calculate Safe Levels:** Find out how low the harmful substances need to go so they won\u2019t hurt the wildlife anymore.\n   \n3. **Protect While Cleaning Up:**\n   - **Evaluate Cleanup Methods:** Choose ways to clean up"

    "output": " a hundred countries now participate in the IBO, so its courses are internationally recognized. But what makes it special is that it offers not only a rigorous academic program but also a broad-based one that includes practical and creative areas. This gives students the opportunity to develop their skills and abilities in different contexts.\n\nThe emphasis on Theory of Knowledge (TOK) and the Extended Essay means students are given the chance to think about their own thinking and learning, and to explore a topic that interests them in depth. Students also carry out a range of projects through the Creativity, Action, Service (CAS) part of the Diploma programme. These allow them to develop personal skills such as leadership and teamwork, and to reflect on their experiences.\n\nThe IB Diploma programme is challenging. It requires hard work, commitment and self-discipline. In return, students receive a well-rounded education, which prepares them well for university and adult life.\n\nWhy should I consider taking the IB Diploma programme?\n\nThe IB Diploma is a well-regarded, rigorous qualification that is highly respected by universities and employers. Many universities give IB students a certain number of credits, meaning that they may be able to skip some of the first year if they get high grades in the right subjects. Taking the IB Diploma will show universities that you are academically capable and have a wide range of skills and abilities.\n\nWhat is a \"rigorous\" programme?\n\nRigorous means difficult and demanding. The IB Diploma programme requires students to study six subjects, two of which are at a higher level. Students take examinations in all subjects at the end of the programme, including the three core elements. They are expected to complete an Extended Essay, which involves researching a topic and writing an essay of 4000 words. They must also undertake a range of projects and activities as part of the Creativity, Action, Service (CAS) requirement.\n\nCan I choose any combination of subjects?\n\nThere are a few rules about which subjects students can choose, but these are mainly there to ensure a broad range of subjects is covered. There must be one subject from groups 1 to 5 and no more than four subjects from the sciences and mathematics. However, within those limits, students can choose any combination of subjects.\n\nWhat is CAS?\n\nCreativity, Action and Service (CAS) is a part of the IB Diploma programme that encourages students to be involved in artistic pursuits, sports and community service work.

    "prompt": "I'm using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to examine how normal (or Gaussian) some data sets I have are. I am having trouble with interpreting the $p$-values (surprise surprise).\n\nMy present understanding is that if the returned $p$-value is $p > 0.05$ this suggests that the data is normally distributed, while datasets which produce a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test result $p < 0.05$ suggest that the data is not normally distributed.\n\nFirstly, is my present understanding/interpretation correct?\n\nSecondly I performed some very basic simulations. I simply generate data sets with $1000$ points which are normally distributed and perform a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test on each one. If I look at the distribution of $p$-values extracted from this, I see a square distribution with values ranging between 0 and 1.\n\nI don't understand this -- I guess I don't really understand $p$-values as I expected for data which definitely is normally distributed (I generated it to be such) that there would be a median $p$-value.\n\n\n1 Answer 1\n\n\nYou're on the right track. Two facts are key for understanding what's going on.\n\nFirst, the null hypothesis $(H_\\emptyset$) of the one-sample K-S test is that the sample data comes from the \"reference\" distribution. When it is being used as a normality test, that reference distribution is a Gaussian.\n\nSecond, for any test, p-values are uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 under the null hypothesis, assuming the test's assumptions are met. See this question for more details. While you should expect small $p$-values if the alternate hypothesis were true, it is not the case that you should expect only large $p$-values under the null hypothesis.\n\nCombining these two facts accounts for your simulation: you set up conditions where the null hypothesis is definitely true, and the resulting p-values form a \"square\" histogram where each bin has approximately the same number of values. If you were to draw samples from a different distribution (e.g., an exponential distribution), you would instead find $p$-values clustered near 0, since it is unlikely that those values could have come from a Gaussian (your $H_\\emptyset$).\n\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ I think I understand a bit more now. So while I observe a square or uniform distribution, I can say 95% of the data sets satisfy the the K-S tests? And I can safely say there is only a 5% chance a truly normal data set will be rejected? $\\endgroup$\n    \u2013\u00a0Q.P.\n    Oct 7, 2020 at 14:59\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ @Q.P.

    "prompt": "Laerd Statistics LoginCookies & Privacy\n\nDependent t-test for paired samples\n\nWhat does this test do?\n\nThe dependent t-test (also called the paired t-test or paired-samples t-test) compares the means of two related groups to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference between these means.\n\nWhat variables do you need for a dependent t-test?\n\nYou need one dependent variable that is measured on an interval or ratio scale (see our Types of Variable guide if you need clarification). You also need one categorical variable that has only two related groups.\n\n\nWhat is meant by \"related groups\"?\n\nA dependent t-test is an example of a \"within-subjects\" or \"repeated-measures\" statistical test. This indicates that the same participants are tested more than once. Thus, in the dependent t-test, \"related groups\" indicates that the same participants are present in both groups. The reason that it is possible to have the same participants in each group is because each participant has been measured on two occasions on the same dependent variable. For example, you might have measured the performance of 10 participants in a spelling test (the dependent variable) before and after they underwent a new form of computerised teaching method to improve spelling. You would like to know if the computer training improved their spelling performance. Here, we can use a dependent t-test because we have two related groups. The first related group consists of the participants at the beginning (prior to) the computerised spell training and the second related group consists of the same participants, but now at the end of the computerised training.\n\n\nDoes the dependent t-test test for \"changes\" or \"differences\" between related groups?\n\nThe dependent t-test can be used to test either a \"change\" or a \"difference\" in means between two related groups, but not both at the same time. Whether you are measuring a \"change\" or \"difference\" between the means of the two related groups depends on your study design. The two types of study design are indicated in the following diagrams.\n\nHow do you detect differences between experimental conditions using the dependent t-test?\n\nThe dependent t-test can look for \"differences\" between means when participants are measured on the same dependent variable under two different conditions. For example, you might have tested participants' eyesight (dependent variable) when wearing two different types of spectacle (independent variable).

Now the condition of equal pressure will be found when the perpendicular distance of those two points is same from the surface(can be regarded as the apparent depth of the point).\n\nApplying that condition you should get your answer. P.S. i haven't calculated the answer but i don't think $a=2g$ is right...\n\nshare|improve this answer\nI got the intuition behind the method that I have to apply. But what if the vessel is closed and the net amount of water remains same therefore preventing any change in surface profile? \u2013\u00a0 Satwik Pasani Jun 28 '13 at 5:29\nyou'll have to find the force the walls exert on the fluid, and treat it just like external atmospheric pressure. But the force will be different at each point, and i'm not really sure how to calculate that. that's why i didn't post it. \u2013\u00a0 udiboy1209 Jun 28 '13 at 12:46\n\nYour Answer\n\n\n<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>",

If I am wrong, please provide the solution. The problem is as follows:\n\nA cubical vessel of side $a$ contains water filled up to height $h (h \\lt a)$. The vessel is accelerating horizontally with acceleration $a$. The angle made by the free surface of water with the vertical walls of the vessel is $\\theta$. What is the value of $h/a$?\n\nMy Attempt: We know that when a vessel is accelerated horizontally, the free surface makes an angle $\\theta$ with the horizontal such that\n\n$$\\tan \\theta = \\frac{a}{g}$$\n\nSo, now in the given situation, we can consider the cubical vessel as a wedge inclined at an angle $\\theta$ with horizontal and filled up to height $h$. So, the apparent depth of the bottom most point will be $h / \\sin \\theta$ and of the topmost point will be $(h+a/2)/\\sin \\theta$, which means the height of the liquid column between the two points is $a/2\\sin \\theta$, so, the pressure difference would be $pa/2\\sin \\theta$."
