    "prompt": "Analysis of a single candle flame (or stick)\n\nYes, so\u2026- we start, we light up..,\nrocket\u2026- \u201claunch\u201d\u2026\nsupersonic\u2026 IT\u2026- we explore\u2026\n\nSo that we can look closely at this single flame (at the beginning of the candle), it must somehow exist and last for a certain period.\nWe will not discuss all aspects of the topic in our analysis (e.g. ways of initialization). We will focus on those that have a concrete impact on the expected Process or Effect (in practical design). The absolute basis for the analysis of the flame is the famous one: \u201cBurnt Triangle\u201d, already sufficient for fat, mourning, and: \u201cQuadrilateral of Combustion\u201d, (preceded by this \u201cTriangle\u201d), necessary for flame burning.\n\nCorrect combustion triangle according to a thorough analysis of the combustion of Stanis\u0142aw Ranger Combustion Quadrangle\n\nOf course, the above scheme is indicated mainly for:\n\n  1. Total combustion, which occurs when a whole mass of the burned substance is oxidized.\n    It occurs when not only does there be no smoke or combustible substances in the ash, but also part of the fuel in the form of steam does not escape. Total combustion occurs as a result of the reaction of oxygen to the substance, when the amount of oxygen is not less than the resulting stoichiometry.\n  2. Complete combustion, the product of which is the most durable of the possible chemical compound in a given reaction, e.g. C + O2 CO2, whether combustion will be complete or incomplete is determined by the over-air factor.\n  3. and the excess air ratio.\n\nThis applies to these ideal, \u201ccosmic\u201d conditions for such combustion, but, but \u2013 let\u2019s go down to our, \u201cEarth\u201d, because this is where these \u201cstairs\u201d begin.\n\nA\u2019propos of these stairs (and the Cosmos..!). As a musician, guitarist \u2013 I \u201cgrew up\u201d m. Others. on such hits as this song: Stairway To Heaven \u2013 Led Zeppelin. Somehow the \u201cburned out\u201d creative vena in today\u2019s Creators, because it is difficult to find works that match (including Stylu..!) \u2013 the above.. Too bad.\nAaa like \u201cfiring\u201d, we also have to deal with this \u2013 just as if, so you have to go to these \u201cstairs\u201d, after which we get to what?. Aaa, well, for the \u201cburner\u201d of mobile-portable, light, \u201cO\u201dptymal\nIii\u2026 This\u2026 leitmotiv\u2019em\u2026 let this imperative Work be for us:\n\nOur steps to these \u2026- \u201cstairs\u201d, is \u2026- the ability to perceive and the result first \u2013 questions, answers \u2026 (to be verified..!), theoretical on technical\u2026 (models to test..!), errors.. \u2013 ability to assess and eliminate them\u2026-\n\nI realized quite early on that\u2026 The principle of \u201cTriangle, Quadruple Combustion\u201d for solid fuels\u2026 (biomass..!) \u2013 just as readable and simple in Theory \u2013 proves to this day one of the biggest problems when the requirement is the so-called. Total\ncomplete combustion. Without being any professional specialist in this field \u2013 as an amateur, passionate\u2026 (who like tough challenges..!) \u2013 I began to search the Internet, available materials, elaborations and videos \u2013 asking myself \u2026 (after testing..!) \u2013 these questions. These tests and model trials eventually gave me answers to such compliciting questions.\n\nPatent.., the solution turned out to be ...- so simple that\u2026 until funny\u2026 I was therefore surprised by the fact that this simplicity was not used in furnace structures. However, this place is often done intricate \u201ceccentricity\u201d structuralism, which still do not fully produce the expected results. Signaling my successful constructions \u2013 sometimes on other discussion forums \u2013 I asked puzzling, sort of leading questions about. important aspects and the necessary\u2026 (w/g me..!) \u2013 to be taken into account. Problems such as\u2026\u00a0diffusion, blue flame and soot\nare not sufficiently and properly interpreted and in the solutions \u2013 applied.\n\nThis\u2026 Blog-Forum\u2026 \u00a0it was launched because when i started to give on another Forum, describe elements of my structures or indicate certain phenomena \u2026 (effects..!) \u2013 I noticed the \u201ccunning\u201d practice of misappropriation by my \u201cpatents\u201d. Also my friends noticed such \u201ctendencies\u201d warning with such attention for me..: \u201creveal your solutions in stages forum-blog, the most important give at the end, because \u2026 there will be those who will immediately say so\u2026 :\n\u201cI knew it a long time ago, I did.., but I did not show, booo \u2026- I did not want\u201c\u201d\u2026!!!\nI have given up patenting in favor of \u2013 selfless publication, but with the reservation of dot. \u201cCopyright\u201d for my technical solutions.\nYes, so\u2026- again\u2026 (now with you..!) \u2013 together we go on these \u2026- stairs\n\n1. Step and step first\n\nQuestion: what can be the smallest, bio-mass stove where clean combustion will be expected (total, complete!), what is it, what and how is it made?\nAnswer: it\u2019s simple \u2013 wire (under 6-ohm, straight angles \u2013 bent!).\n\nI\u2019m not kidding\u2026 (below \u2013 a series of pics of such \u2026- present..!)\n\nFuel for the stove\u2026 (Drucika..!) \u2013 candle\nFast heat-resistant \u2013 just to show different degrees of combustion process on it\u2026\nInstead of fast \u2013 you can bet eg. bowl with 50 ml of water\u2026 (to boil).\n\nRanger tests on the next page.\n\nPages: 1\u00a0\u00a02\n\nComments |0|\n\nLegend *) Required fields are marked\nCategory: Analysis",
