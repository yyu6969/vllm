    "prompt": "Describe how neural networks process data to find patterns.",
    "output": " Neural networks are a type of machine learning algorithm that are designed to mimic the structure and function of the human brain. They consist of interconnected nodes or neurons, which are organized into layers. The input layer receives data, which is then passed through one or more hidden layers for processing, and finally produces an output.\n\nTo find patterns in the data, neural networks use a combination of techniques. First, they learn from example data, adjusting their internal parameters (weights) based on the difference between their predicted output and the actual output. This process is called training, and it involves presenting the network with many examples of input-output pairs and adjusting the weights"
