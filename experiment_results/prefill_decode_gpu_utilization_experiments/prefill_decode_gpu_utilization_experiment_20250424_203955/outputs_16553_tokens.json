Isaac Newton\n\u00a0d. Wilhelm Wien\n\u00a0e. Ludwig Boltzmann\n\n2. Which of the following statements about the nucleus of a typical atom (such as the carbon in your little finger) is FALSE:\n\n\u00a0a. the nucleus has an overall positive charge\n\u00a0b. the nucleus takes up a very small amount of space compared to the entire atom\n\u00a0c. the nucleus can contain both protons and neutrons\n\u00a0d. the nucleus repels the electrons which move around it\n\u00a0e. the nucleus contains most of the mass of the atom\n\n3. In the 19th century, it became clear that magnetism was not a separate force, but was always produced by the action of\n\n\u00a0a. electric charges that were in motion\n\u00a0b. the gravitational pull of the Earth\n\u00a0c. the strong nuclear force acting on electrons\n\u00a0d. light moving through a vacuum\n\u00a0e. rubbing a boy scout and a girl scout together to produce a fire\n\n4.

Which of the following travels through space the fastest?\n\na. light\nb. radio waves\nc. infrared\nd. x-rays\ne. you can't fool me, all of these travel through space at the same speed\n\n7. The fastest speed in the universe is:\n\na. the speed of sound\nb. the speed of light\nc. the speed of electron oscillations\nd. the speed with which Mercury orbits the Sun\ne. the speed with which weekends seem to pass\n\n8. The light which allows you to see this very interesting exam is made up of waves. In these waves, the distance between crests is called the:\n\na. frequency\nb. velocity\nc. wavelength\nd. amplitude\ne. you can't fool me; in these waves, the distance between crests is zero\n\n9. Which of the following has the longest wavelength?\n\na. radio\nb. visible light\nc. ultraviolet\nd. x-rays\ne. you can't fool me, all these have the same wavelength\n\n10.

Which of the following statements about photons is FALSE?\n\na. photons always travel at the speed of light\nb. photons each carry a specific amount of energy\nc. a photon of light cannot pass through the atmosphere of the Earth, and thus cannot be seen at the Earth's surface\nd. high energy photons have a high frequency\ne. a gamma-ray photon is more energetic than a visible light photon\n\n14. After a nice dinner around the campfire on a camping trip, you and a friend decide to get away from the fire to observe the stars. As you get farther and farther away, you see the brightness of the fire:\n\na. increase with distance\nb. remain the same\nc. decrease as the distance squared\nd. change more and more in color (becoming redder)\ne. this can't be answered without having more information\n\n15. Not all wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation can penetrate the Earth's atmosphere. Of the following types of waves that come from space, which one are you likely to be able to detect most easily from our planet's surface:\n\na. x-rays\nb. gamma rays\nc. infrared waves\nd. ultraviolet waves\ne. radio waves of the wavelength that carry FM broadcasts\n\n16. Most ultraviolet radiation does not penetrate to the Earth's surface. Instead it is absorbed in:\n\na. the ozone layer\nb. the ionosphere\nc. the region between the Earth and the Sun\nd. stratosphere\ne. tanning zone\n\n17. Human eyes evolved to detect visible light because:\n\na. it is the lowest energy band of the electromagnetic spectrum and thus easiest to detect\nb. it is the only kind of radiation that penetrates the Earth's atmosphere at all\nc. it is the band of the spectrum which is the least Doppler shifted coming from the Sun\nd. it is the band of the spectrum where the Sun puts out the most energy\ne. it is the band of the spectrum where the warm Earth glows the most effectively at night\n\n18. Which of the following statements about infrared radiation is TRUE?\n\na. it is the band of the electromagnetic spectrum where each wave or photon has the greatest energy\nb. it was first discovered in 1800 in an experiment using sunlight and thermometers\nc. unlike light, infrared can never travel as fast as the speed of light\nd. while many stars give off infrared, there is nothing on Earth at the right temperature to emit it\ne. it is the radiation responsible for giving sunburns (or in large doses, skin cancer)\n\n19. Which of the following is not a type of radio wave?\n\na. microwaves\nb. radar waves\nc. the waves that carry AM or FM broadcasts\nd. the sound waves coming from your transistor radio\ne. the waves that carry television transmissions\n\n20. A politician who has just said something very dumb on an AM all-talk radio station suddenly remembers the astronomy class he had in college,and starts to worry that his words are now moving outward into space at the speed of light (and will embarrass him forever). Does he have a reason to worry?\n\na. Yes, because all radio waves do travel at the speed of light and all of them escape from the Earth\nb. No, because radio waves travel much slower than the speed of light and will take a very long time to get anywhere\nc. No, because radio waves are all absorbed by the ozone layer in the Earth's atmosphere\nd. No, because AM radio waves are bounced back or scattered by the ionosphere\ne. Yes, because while all radio waves do not escape from the Earth, AM radio waves do\n\n21. (In the absence of a strong magnetic field), what is the chief factor that determines what type of electromagnetic radiation objects give off:\n\na. their mass\nb. their temperature\nc. their overall motion\nd. their chemical makeup\ne. their size\n\n22. The energy of random atomic and molecular motion is called\n\na. heat\nb. the Doppler shift\nc. spectroscopy\nd. velocity\ne. rock and roll\n\n23. Which of the following has the greatest average energy of random atomic and molecular motion?\n\na. a cube of ice\nb. a cube of water\nc. a cube of steam\nd. a cube of air (on Earth)\ne. a cube of the Sun\n\n24. An idealized object that does not reflect or scatter any radiation, but simply absorbs every bit of radiation that falls on it is called:\n\na. a Doppler surface\nb. an electromagnetic radiator\nc. a blackbody\nd. a spectrum\ne. a vice president\n\n25. Two stars are giving off electromagnetic radiation. The hotter star will:\n\na. give off more radiation at all wavelengths\nb. will have a higher average frequency of radiation\nc. will radiate energy at more than one wavelength\nd. will give off a continuous spectrum of waves\ne. all of the above\n\n26. An astronomer discovers a new star and wants to measure its temperature. She would do this by:\n\na. measuring the Doppler shift of its spectral lines\nb. making a blackbody curve and finding the wavelength of the peak (maximum)\nc. measuring the intensity of radio waves the star gives off\nd. measuring how much light the star reflects\ne. sending a graduate student with a very long (and durable) thermometer to the\nstar's vicinity\n\n27. An astronomer observes two ordinary stars. The first one turns out to be twice as hot as the second. This means that the first one radiates:\n\na. twice as much energy as the second\nb. roughly the same amount of energy as the second\nc. half as much energy as the second\nd. about 16 times the energy of the second\ne. this problem cannot be solved with just the information we were given\n\n29. Which of the following is NOT done best with a spectrometer?\n\na. measuring how bright sources of light in the universe appear\nb. measuring the different colors in the spectrum\nc. measuring the amount that lines are Doppler shifted\nd. measuring what elements are present in a star\ne. measuring what conditions are like in the cool atmosphere of a star\n\n30. An artist who likes working with sources of light decides to make a modern sculpture out of electrified glass tubes that contain very thin(rarified) neon gas. When the sculpture is finished, and the electricity is turned on, the tubes glow with a rich red color. What we are seeing is:\n\na. a continuous spectrum\nb. an absorption spectrum\nc. an emission spectrum\nd. a Doppler shift\ne. all of the above\n\n32. One of the great triumphs of spectroscopy was when astronomers identified a new element in the Sun (one that was only later found on Earth). Today, this element is called:\n\na. Solarium\nb. Hydrogen\nc. Einsteinium\nd. Helium\ne. Astronomium\n\n33. If I were to scale up an atom until it were the size of a sports arena, the space filled by the positive charges inside the atom (according to the work of Ernest Rutherford early in this century) would be:\n\na. as big as the entire stadium (and very thinly spread out)\nb. as big as the space filled by all the negative charges (that's why the atom is neutral)\nc. very small (perhaps the size of a soccer ball) and in the middle\nd. an extremely thin layer spread completely around the outer walls of the stadium\ne. this question cannot be answered (even roughly) without knowing which kind of atom we are discussing\n\n34. Atoms typically consist of electrons, protons, and neutrons. The most common isotope of one element, however, only has two of these three types of particles. This element is:\n\na. helium\nb. hydrogen\nc. uranium\nd. carbon\ne. silicon\n\n35. Two versions of an element with different numbers of neutrons are called:\n\na. molecules\nb. electron pairs\nc. isotopes\nd. ions\ne. re-runs\n\n36. As of the time our textbook went to press, 111 elements had been discovered. All of the ones over 92 have been made in physics laboratories. When element 112 is found, provided it is like the other artificially made elements, it will:\n\na. have only protons, no neutrons at all\nb. soon be used in industry to make new kinds of plastics\nc. have one of the smallest nuclei known\nd. only remain stable for an extremely small fraction of a second\ne. eventually be found in the Sun (with very high quality spectrometers)\n\n37. The idea that atoms radiate energy only when their electrons move from higher to lower energy levels was first advanced by:\n\na. J. J. Thomson\nb. Niels Bohr\nc. Ernest Rutherford\nd. Albert Einstein\ne. Christian Doppler\n\n38. Why do different types of atoms (elements) give off or absorb different spectral lines?\n\na. all elements have the same lines, but they are Doppler shifted by different amounts\nb. in some elements, electrons can only move to odd numbered levels, in others only to even numbered ones\nc. in heavier elements, diffraction spreads out the lines that the atom produces, making the colors different\nd. because the spacing of the energy levels is different in different atoms\ne. because some atoms do not have a ground state, while others have three or four\n\n39. When an atom has lost one or more electrons, it is said to be:\n\na. ionized\nb. excited\nc. in its ground state\nd. red shifted\ne. over the hill\n\n40. What happens as an electron falls from a higher level to a lower level in an atom?\n\na. a photon is given off\nb. the color of the wave involved shifts to the red\nc. a photon is absorbed\nd. another electron from the lower level takes its place\ne. nothing happens; electrons can only go from a lower level to a higher level\n\n41. How do astronomers learn what elements are present in a given star?\n\na. look at what color light dominates its continuous spectrum\nb. listen for coded signals in the radio waves it gives off in the FM band\nc. look at the absorption lines in its spectrum\nd. send spacecraft like Voyager to examine its make-up from close-up\ne. compare visible-light photographs of the star (taken with large telescopes) to those of the Sun.\n\n42. You are alone in a large, completely dark auditorium on Earth. What kind of telescope should I use from the other side of the auditorium to detect the electromagnetic radiation emitted by your body?\n\na. visible light\nb. infra-red\nc. ultra-violet\nd. black light\ne. no telescope will be effective if I am in a dark room\n\n43. I want to examine the surface of a planet which is covered by a thick atmosphere (which includes oxygen and contains a very thick layer of water clouds that never clear). What wavelength of electromagnetic radiation would I be smartest to use:\n\na. visible light\nb. x-rays\nc. radar waves\nd. ultra-violet\ne. none would work\n\n44. Planck's constant relates:\n\na. the energy of a wave to the number of protons in the nucleus of the atom that emitted it\nb. the frequency of a wave to its energy\nc. the maximum energy emitted by a blackbody to its temperature\nd. the energy emitted by a star to its temperature\ne. the Doppler shift of a light source to its speed\n\n45. Which of the following consists of electro-magnetic waves with the shortest wavelength?\n\na. a beam of green light\nb. TV transmissions bringing us Monday night football\nc. the sound of the instructor's voice\nd. the waves of a dental x-ray\ne. the rays that tan a sunbather on the beach\n\n46. The two regions of the electromagnetic spectrum where the Earth's atmosphere is transparent (radiation can get in) are visible light and\n\na. ultraviolet\nb. x-rays\nc. some radio waves\nd. gamma-rays\ne. you can't fool me, the atmosphere is transparent ONLY for visible light\n\n47. Astronomical observatories have been available since ancient times, and many cultures set aside special sites for astronomical observations. What was missing from these observatories until about 1610 was:\n\na. a dark site, where lights did not get in the way\nb. graduate students with the ability to climb up to higher altitudes\nc. instruments for detecting radio waves\nd. a way of measuring from what direction in the sky a beam of light was coming\ne. telescopes\n\n48. The most important function of an astronomical telescope is to:\n\na. collect as much light as possible and bring it to a focus\nb. magnify (enlarge) celestial objects so we can see them clearly\nc. measure the color of an object\nd. bring distant objects closer by pulling on the light\ne. pierce through the clouds so a cloudy night is not wasted\n\n49. The first person (to the best of our knowledge) to turn a telescope to astronomical observations was:\n\na. Isaac Newton\nb. Galileo Galilei\nc. Adam Refractor\nd. Edwin Hubble\ne. Karl Jansky\n\n50. The size of the device that gathers (collects) radiation is called a telescope's:\n\na. magnification\nb. resolution\nc. aperture\nd. focal width\ne. Galilean criterion\n\n51. At the largest and most modern astronomical observatories on Earth today, which of the following regularly happens to the image formed by the telescope?\n\na. it is viewed by a group of graduate students who then make a sketch of it to have a permanent record\nb. it is recorded on a piece of black and white film, which is then developed\nc. it is reflected by a special arrangement of mirrors back into the beam and up into the sky\nd. it is recorded using an electronic detector called a CCD for later analysis\ne. it is recorded as a radio signal and sent by satellite to other observatories around the world\n\n52. The earliest telescopes used by astronomers were:\n\na. reflectors\nb. refractors\nc. radio telescopes\nd. about the aperture of the telescope on Mount Palomar\ne. used late at night to look into the neighbors' windows\n\n53. Your friend, a graduate student in astronomy, is giving you a special tour of the local observatory. You notice that in viewing the image from the telescope you are seeing it from underneath the primary mirror; the beam of light has come through a small hole in the main mirror to an eyepiece below. This telescope uses what focusing arrangement?\n\na. prime focus\nb. Newtonian focus\nc. Cassegrain focus\nd. Galilean focus\ne. out of focus\n\n54. The largest visible-light telescopes in the world use what device to collect as much light as possible before the light is brought to a focus (to act as the light bucket)?\n\na. lens\nb. spectroscope\nc. CCD\nd. mirror\ne. a valley in Puerto Rico\n\n55. Today, the largest telescope in the world that uses visible light is:\n\na. the Mount Palomar telescope\nb. the telescope in the valley in Puerto Rico\nc. the 236-inch in the Caucasus Mountains of the former Soviet Union\nd. the Keck Telescope in Hawaii\ne. the Hubble Space Telescope\n\n56.

To get away from the pressures of your astronomy class you and some friends decide to go to a football game. In the stadium, a friend gives you her binoculars to look through, and suddenly you realize that you are back to a subject covered in astronomy class. What type of telescope are you looking through when you use binoculars?\n\na. reflecting\nb. infra-red\nc. refracting\nd. Newtonian\ne. CCD\n\n58. A graduate student is trying to follow the weather on Jupiter for her PhD thesis. To see individual storms in the upper atmosphere of the planet, she needs to have excellent resolution. What type of telescope would be best for her to use?\n\na. a refractor, with as small an aperture as possible\nb. a radio telescope\nc. a large reflector in an observatory located at sea level\nd. a large reflector located in orbit above the Earth's atmosphere\ne. you can't fool me, no telescope can show the weather on Jupiter\n\n59. A new technique called adaptive optics allows astronomers to:\n\na. change the eyepieces of their telescopes much more quickly than ever before\nb. compensate for changes in the Earth's atmosphere and achieve better resolution\nc. increase the aperture of their telescopes by a very large factor\nd. change the region of the electro-magnetic spectrum in which their telescope is able to detect radiation\ne. use the observatory shop to make better eye-glasses for their graduate students\n\n60. Why do telescopes have to have a good motorized drive system to move them quickly and smoothly?\n\na. because the Earth is rotating with the telescope\nb. because astronomers typically have to look at many objects in the sky in a few minutes\nc. because all objects in the sky vary in brightness very quickly\nd. because the telescope can then be moved out from under the clouds to where it is clear\ne. because shooting stars (which is what astronomers mainly follow) move so quickly across the sky during a typical night\n\n61. When an astronomer involved in a research project says he is going to look at the observatory's plate collection, what will he be looking at?\n\na. a collection of souvenir plates, with painting of other observatories from around the world (astronomers collect these as a hobby)\nb. a series of metal disks used for changing the aperture of reflecting telescopes\nc. a series of glass plates, with light-sensitive chemicals on them, on which the appearance of the sky is recorded\nd. a series of insulated plastic shields, which are used to prevent stray infrared radiation from the observatory from interfering with observations\ne. what the special of the day is in the observatory cafeteria\n\n62.

To break up light into the component colors that it contains astronomers use a device called:\n\na. a telescope\nb. a CCD\nc. a spectrometer\nd. Cassegrain splitter\ne. interferometer array\n\n67. The largest refracting telescope in the world, financed by a Chicago millionaire in the 1890's is at the:\n\na. Lick Observatory\nb. Yerkes Observatory\nc. Keck Observatory\nd. Hale Observatory\ne. Fraknoi/Morrison/Wolff Observatory\n\n68. A very wealthy donor decides to give a large sum of money to your college or university to build the world's largest visible-light gathering telescope. From an astronomical perspective, where would be the best location to put such a telescope?\n\na. in a dark spot right on the campus\nb. on the west coast of the U.S. very close to sea level (a location like Seattle, for example)\nc. close to a large city where there are many astronomers to use it\nd. on a tall, dry mountain peak\ne. wherever the donor wants to put it\n\n69. The first radio telescope was built in the 1930's by\n\na. Karl Jansky\nb. George Ellery Hale\nc. Edwin Hubble\nd. a consortium of European astronomers\ne. Heinrich Hertz\n\n70. Radio telescopes of modest size can't make out as much detail (have a lower resolution) than visible light telescopes. How do astronomers overcome this limitation?\n\na. we have built a radio telescope in the desert that covers 1000 square miles\nb. this problem can't be solved; radio telescopes will always show less detail\nc. we can connect several radio telescopes some distance apart together electronically to give us the resolution of a larger telescope\nd. we have launched several radio telescope satellites into orbit; each of which make out much more detail than visible light telescopes\ne. the same engineers responsible for the shape of the mirror for the Hubble Space Telescope are working on this problem; stay tuned\n\n71. In a radio telescope, the role that the mirror plays in visible-light telescopes is played by\n\na. a spectrometer\nb. an interferometer\nc. computer software\nd. a special kind of lens\ne. a large metal dish\n\n72.

What was the major problem with the Hubble Space Telescope when it was first launched into orbit?\n\na. its antenna wouldn't open, so the data could not be sent back to Earth\nb. it was in the wrong orbit, so it dipped down into the Earth's thicker atmosphere regularly\nc. its spectroscope broke during the launch\nd. the mirror's shape was slightly off, so all the light did not come to a single focus\ne. the mirror cover was stuck in the partly on position, making part of the mirror not usable\n\n77. In the summer of 1996, the European Space Agency announced that it would be suspending the operations of the International Ultraviolet Explorer.

As astronomers learn more about the structure of the Sun, they find that it\n\na. has a small solid core inside\nb. is made entirely of liquid and (on the outside) hot gas\nc. is solid throughout, but with a large very hot atmosphere\nd. is made entirely of hot gas\ne. is made of billions of individual pieces of hot rock, all orbiting around each other in a whirling arrangement\n\n82. You are out on the beach, enjoying the warm sunshine with friends. As you glance (briefly we hope) up at the Sun, the part of the Sun that you can see directly is called its:\n\na. corona\nb. photosphere\nc. chromosphere\nd. core\ne. heliopause\n\n83. How do astronomers know what the outer layers of the Sun are made of?\n\na. we send graduate students to get samples\nb. spacecraft with good shielding have approached the Sun and obtained samples\nc. the surface layers of Mercury have been laid down by the Sun and are thus made of the same material as the Sun\nd. the Sun's wind gives us an accurate measure of all the different elements in the Sun\ne. we take an absorption line spectrum of the Sun, and the absorption lines tell us what elements are present in the outer layers\n\n84. The most common element in the Sun is\n\na. helium\nb. iron\nc. hydrogen\nd. water\ne. nitrogen\n\n85. The hotter region directly above the Sun's visible surface is called the\n\na. chromosphere\nb. photosphere\nc. corona\nd. ionization region\ne. convection zone\n\n86. As you go upwards from the Sun's photosphere,\n\na. the temperature decreases\nb. the density (number of atoms in a unit volume) decreases\nc. the layers get easier to see with the unaided eye\nd. the kinds of atoms present change drastically\ne. only red light can emerge\n\n87. The Sun's chromosphere and corona were discovered\n\na. using the first telescopes Galileo built\nb. in the late 19th century through the use of a spectrograph\nc. during total eclipses of the Sun\nd. using spacecraft that orbited Venus, a planet with a better view of the Sun\ne. by ancient shepherds, who saw reflections of the Sun in quiet pools of water\n\n88. The Sun's chromosphere contains many jet like projections that stick up into the transition region. These spikes of gas are called:\n\na. coronae\nb. spicules\nc. plages\nd. flares\ne. prominences\n\n89. Which part of the Sun's atmosphere is the hottest?\n\na. chromosphere\nb. transition region\nc. corona\nd. just above the photosphere\ne. you can't fool me, all these regions are at roughly the same temperature\n\n90. Which part of the Sun's atmosphere has the lowest density (number of atoms per unit volume)?\n\na. corona\nb. transition region\nc. chromosphere\nd. just above the photosphere\ne. you can't fool me, all these regions are at roughly the same density\n\n91.

Astronomers first detected the presence of a wind of particles coming from the Sun by\n\na. sending a spacecraft much closer to the Sun than the planet Mercury\nb. by noting its effects on the atmosphere of Venus\nc. by dramatic and sudden changes in the spectrum of coronium\nd. using the experiments aboard Sputnik 1, the first spacecraft to go above the Earth's atmosphere\ne. by noting the wind's effects on the tails of comets\n\n93. The ten million tons of particles that escape the Sun each year in the form of the solar wind get out mainly from regions called\n\na. sunspots\nb. spicules\nc. aurorae\nd. coronal holes\ne. transition regions\n\n94. Solar wind particles can be captured by the Earth's magnetosphere. When these particles spiral down along the magnetic field into the atmosphere, they are responsible for:\n\na. aurorae (northern and southern lights)\nb. tropical storms (regions of rapidly rotating air)\nc. the greenhouse effect\nd. the reddish color we see during sunsets\ne. the poor quality of television programming in the world's northern hemisphere\n\n95. The granulation pattern that astronomers have observed on the surface of the Sun tells us that:\n\na. the Sun is a lot cooler on the inside than on the outside\nb. the Sun's surface is made of a thin solid that cracks easily\nc. hot material must be rising from the Sun's hotter interior\nd. the solar wind must consist of very small (low-mass) particles\ne. the Sun accumulates a lot of dirt and dust because of its large gravity\n\n96. Sunspots are darker than the regions of the Sun around them because\n\na. they consist of different elements than the rest of the Sun\nb. they are located in the corona and not on the photosphere\nc. they move much faster around the Sun than other material and thus heat up\nd. they are the shadows of the planets and asteroids seen on the bright surface of the Sun\ne. they are cooler than the material around them (although still very hot compared to Earth temperatures)\n\n97. Astronomers have concluded that the Sun's activity varies in an 11-year cycle. Which of the following statements about this cycle is TRUE:\n\na. Every 11 years sunspots completely cover the Sun, making its surface much darker\nb. The number of sunspots gets larger and smaller over the course of 11 years\nc. When sunspots are at a minimum, we get the largest number of flares and prominences\nd. The Sun's activity cycle shows absolutely no connection to its magnetic field\ne. The Sun's activity cycle is directly connected to the number of earthquakes at the continental plate boundaries on Earth\n\n98. How do astronomers know how strong the magnetic field of the Sun is?\n\na. they measure the magnetic field of the Earth, which is a direct result of the magnetic field of the Sun\nb. they measure the Sun's rotation using the Doppler effect\nc. they count the number of days in the year that we get an aurora in the upper atmosphere\nd. the measure the Zeeman effect (the splitting of spectral lines)\ne. the diameter of a star is directly related to the size of its magnetic field\n\n99. A Canadian college student who has taken an astronomy class goes home for the holidays and persuades his parents to let him borrow the family car. When he returns, he finds that his parents are very angry with him, claiming he left the garage door open. Yet he remembers that he carefully closed the garage door. After consulting with his astronomy instructor, he comes up with an alternative explanation for why the garage door is open. Which of the following is PART of that explanation?\n\na. The Sun was so bright and high in the sky in December in Canada that it got into his parents' eyes\nb. There was an eclipse of the Sun\nc. It was a time of solar maximum, and there had been a flare on the Sun\nd. No aurorae had been seen in the sky for many months\ne. The number of sunspots had reached an all-time minimum\n\n100. Which of the following is not part of some active regions on the Sun?\n\na. sunspots\nb. flares\nc. plages\nd. prominences\ne. granulation\n\n101. Astronomers now realize that active regions on the Sun are connected with\n\na. the dark regions between the bright granulation cells on the photosphere\nb. loops of magnetic field emerging from the surface of the Sun\nc. the absence of sunspots during a solar minimum\nd. great tropical storm systems in the Earth's atmosphere\ne. changes in the gravitational pull of the Sun over different parts of its photosphere\n\n102. Astronomers have found that the level of the Sun's activity varies over the centuries. How did they come to realize that this is so:\n\na. historical records of the number of sunspots seen on the Sun\nb. measuring the amount of radioactive carbon in tree rings\nc. historical records of auroral activity\nd. all of the above\ne. none of the above\n\n103. On Earth, a period of low solar activity, such as the Maunder Minimum, means:\n\na. less volcanic activity\nb. a climate with cooler temperatures\nc. a significant increase in the number of aurorae seen\nd. a much larger number of cloudy days\ne. very little; there is no connection between the Sun's activity and what happens on Earth\n\n104. Recently, some engineers and scientists have proposed building spaceships with enormous \"sails\" that catch the solar wind and use it to move the ship. What kinds of particles would be hitting this sail (i.e. what is the solar wind mostly made of):\n\na. nuclei of heavier atoms such as iron and nickel\nb. calcium atoms\nc. electrons and protons\nd. gamma-rays\ne. scientists do not have any idea of the composition of the solar wind; it is very mysterious\n\n105. When we use the light of atoms such as hydrogen and calcium to examine the Sun's outer layers, we can see bright \"clouds\" in the chromosphere\nright around the location of sunspots. These bright clouds are given the name:\n\na. granules\nb. spot umbras\nc. active regions\nd. Zeeman rings\ne. plages\n\n106. A friend (who does not have the vast new awareness which you have gained from this course) suggests that the mechanism that keeps the Sun shining as brightly as it does is the burning of coal. You brilliantly challenge his theory! Your challenge comes in several steps; which of the following is one of those steps?\n\na. we have found many more neutrinos than we expected in our underground experiments\nb. new protostars shine by gravitational collapse (the heat of clumping)\nc. the dating of radioactive rocks show that the Earth and the Sun are billions of years old\nd. most of the Sun is made of antimatter (which explodes when it touches matter)\ne. the C-N-O cycle can also produce helium\n\n107. When did scientists begin to understand how the Sun produces all the energy that it does?\n\na. Most of the process was already understood by the ancient Greeks\nb. Most of the process was understood by the end of the 18th century (the year 1800)\nc. Most of the process was understood by the end of the 19th century (the year 1900)\nd. The process was not well understood until the 1930's\ne. You can't fool me; astronomers still don't have a clue about how the Sun produces energy\n\n109. Physicists Kelvin and Helmholtz in the last century proposed that the source of the Sun's energy could be:\n\na. radioactive rocks\nb. a slow contraction\nc. meteorites falling in\nd. the annihilation of antimatter\ne. nuclear fusion\n\n110. Today we realize that the source of energy for the Sun is a process called\n\na. nuclear fusion\nb. Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction\nc. mechanical to thermal energy conversion\nd. radioactivity\ne. dilithium crystal moderation\n\n111. According to the formula E=mc2\n\na. mass has to travel at the speed of light before it can produce any energy\nb. energy can travel much faster than light (in fact its speed can be the speed of light squared)\nc. a little bit of mass can be converted into a substantial amount of energy\nd. when two masses collide, we always get a lot of light\ne. Einstein was a male chauvinist twice over\n\n112. In the formula E=mc2 the letter c stands for\n\na. the speed of sound\nb. the speed of an electron around the nucleus\nc. the amount of energy contained in one hydrogen nucleus\nd. the energy of a neutrino emerging from the Sun\ne. the speed of light\n\n113. The antimatter version of an electron is called a\n\na. proton\nb. neutrino\nc. antitron\nd. positron\ne. gammatron\n\n114. In the Sun, when a positron and an electron collide, they will produce:\n\na. a deuteron\nb. a neutron\nc. hydrogen\nd. a neutron\ne. energy in the form of a gamma ray\n\n115. Which of the following statements about antimatter is true?\n\na. antimatter is only a theory, we have no evidence that it exists\nb. antimatter only exists in Earth laboratories; it cannot be made in stars\nc. antimatter cannot be made in laboratories; we have tried but it just can't be done\nd. when equal amounts of matter and antimatter meet, they become pure energy\ne. our telescopes clearly see many antimatter stars in the Milky Way galaxy\n\n116. As originally suggested by Wolfgang Pauli, neutrinos have the following property:\n\na. they travel at the speed of light\nb. they have no mass\nc. they interact very weakly with ordinary matter\nd. they can be considered little packets of energy\ne. all of the above\n\n117. A college friend of yours who has been postponing taking any science courses hears you talking about the generation of nuclear energy in the Sun and makes the following observation: \"The whole idea of the atomic nucleus is pretty ridiculous. If an oxygen nucleus consists of eight protons and eight neutrons, the charge on the nucleus is positive. Since even I learned in high school that like charges repel, such a nucleus would find itself repulsive and quickly fall apart.\" How would you answer his argument.\n\na. gravity is much stronger than electric repulsion and holds every nucleus together\nb. the neutrons in the nucleus are negative, so they cancel the positive charge on the protons\nc. the nuclear force, which is attractive and stronger than electricity, holds the nucleus together\nd. the electrons outside the nucleus repel the protons and keep them inside the nucleus\ne. there is no answer; scientists do not have a clue about how the nucleus manages to keep itself together\n\n118. Which of the following particles has the lowest mass?\n\na. a neutrino\nb. a proton\nc. a neutron\nd. an electron\ne. the nucleus of a hydrogen atom\n\n119. The strongest force we know is\n\na. gravity, which holds the Earth and the Sun together\nb. electricity, which pulls unlike charges together\nc. the nuclear force which holds nuclei together\nd. the attraction of Bayonne, New Jersey, for tourists\ne. none of the above\n\n120. When two light elements undergo nuclear fusion,\n\na. the total mass involved increases\nb. the like charges in the nuclei attract, pulling the nuclei together faster and faster\nc. some of the energy in their mass is released\nd. only one survives; the other turns into a release of pure energy\ne. the result is always to make nuclei of iron\n\n121. When a large nucleus breaks apart (or is broken apart) into two smaller pieces, this is called\n\na. nuclear fusion\nb. nuclear binding\nc. the p-p chain\nd. equilibrium breaking\ne. nuclear fission\n\n122. If the \"fuel\" for nuclear fusion is nuclei of hydrogen, and the Earth's oceans are filled with hydrogen atoms all being jostled together, why isn't there a lot of fusion happening in our oceans?\n\na. the hydrogen in our oceans is the wrong type of hydrogen for fusion\nb. for hydrogen nuclei to fuse, they must get very close to each other, which the nuclei in the oceans cannot do\nc. for hydrogen to fuse, the nuclei must first join together in long p-p chains of atoms\nd. on Earth, only hydrogen that is in deep mines under the Earth is far enough underground for fusion\ne. you can't fool me, hydrogen in the Earth's oceans does undergo fusion; that's what keeps our oceans warm\n\n123. Where in the Sun does fusion of hydrogen occur?\n\na. only in the core\nb. only near the photosphere (its visible surface layer)\nc. pretty much throughout the Sun\nd. only in the layer where there is a lot of convection going on\ne. nowhere\n\n124. If it takes an average of 14 billion years before any proton inside the Sun will undergo fusion, and the Sun is only about 5 billion years old, why do astronomers believe that fusion is going on there now?\n\na. fusion begins with particles even lighter than protons, which fuse more easily\nb. there are an enormous number of protons inside the Sun, so some will fuse much sooner than the average\nc. fusion takes place in the hot atmosphere of the Sun (where it can happen faster), not inside (where it is slow)\nd. fusion inside the Sun involves carbon, not protons; carbon fuses much more quickly\ne. there is no fusion going on inside the Sun, and the fact cited in the question is one of the reasons why\n\n125. The process of fusion that keeps our Sun shining begins with which building blocks?\n\na. two electrons\nb. two deuterons\nc. two protons\nd. two Einsteinium nuclei\ne. two neutrinos\n\n126. Which of the following is NOT a product of the first step in the p-p chain of nuclear fusion?\n\na. a form of hydrogen\nb. a positron\nc. a neutrino\nd. a deuteron\ne. a form of helium\n\n127. At the end of the p-p chain of nuclear fusion in the Sun, hydrogen nuclei have been converted into:\n\na. carbon nuclei\nb. heavy hydrogen nuclei\nc. antimatter and nothing else\nd. a helium nucleus\ne. a lithium nucleus\n\n128. Who pays the bill for the energy generated by nuclear fusion in the Sun? In other words, where does the energy pouring out of the Sun come from ultimately?\n\na. the Sun is spinning more slowly as time goes on; rotation energy is lost\nb. heavy nuclei are breaking apart into lighter nuclei\nc. a little bit of mass is lost in each reaction and is turned into energy (the Sun is losing mass)\nd. material is falling into the Sun and being vaporized to produce energy\ne. American taxpayers pay this bill, as they do so many others!\n\n129. What happens to the positron created during the p-p chain of nuclear reactions inside the Sun?\n\na. it merges with a proton to become a deuterium (heavy hydrogen) nucleus\nb. it quickly collides with an electron and turns into gamma-ray energy\nc. it ultimately forms an anti-helium nucleus\nd. it turns quickly into a neutrino, which can escape from the Sun\ne. it just sits there at the core of the Sun for billions of years, unable to interact\n\n130. The Sun is an enormous ball of gas. Left to itself, a ball of so many atoms should collapse under its own tremendous gravity. Why is our Sun not collapsing?\n\na. the gravity of the planets around the Sun pulls its material outward, preventing collapse\nb. the pressure of the corona keeps the Sun's main body of gases confined to a small volume\nc. nuclear fusion in the core keeps the temperature and the pressure inside the Sun at a high enough level so that gravity is balanced\nd. neutrinos from the core exert an enormous pressure on the layers of the Sun as they travel outward, and keep our star from collapsing\ne. you can't fool me, the Sun is shrinking all the time, it just happens very slowly\n\n131. When great currents of hot material rise inside the Sun (and cooler material sinks downward), energy is being transferred by a process known as:\n\na. convection\nb. radiation\nc. conduction\nd. equilibrium\ne. politics\n\n132. Which of the following, produced at the core of the Sun, will take the shortest time to emerge from the Sun's photosphere (surface)?\n\na. a photon (wave) of gamma-rays\nb. a positron\nc. a neutrino\nd. a deuteron\ne. an x-ray produced after radiation has interacted with matter in the core\n\n133. Which part of the Sun has the greatest density?\n\na. the photosphere\nb. the core\nc. the convection region\nd. the corona\ne. you can't fool me; since the Sun is made of gas, all its parts have the same density\n\n134. Which of the following is a way for astronomers to learn more about the interior of the Sun?\n\na. study the corona during eclipses of the Sun\nb. study the oscillations (pulsations) of the Sun's surface\nc. follow the orbit of Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun\nd. take photographs of the Sun in the light absorbed by hydrogen atoms\ne. study the accounts in ancient legends of the realm where the devil is supposed to live\n\n135. The Global Oscillations Network Group (GONG) Project is now engaged in:\n\na. measuring where earthquakes happen around the Earth by the waves they generate\nb. measuring the number of sunspots on the surface of the Sun at any given hour\nc. measuring the quality of the \"seeing\" (the jiggling of the Earth's atmosphere) at all the major observatories around the world\nd. measuring the pulsations of the Sun from stations around the world\ne. measuring how problems on the World Wide Web are affecting the communication among astronomers\n\n136. Which of the following is the best statement concerning the experiments that have been searching for neutrinos from the Sun?\n\na. So far, all the experiments have had technical problems detecting neutrinos, which are very \"antisocial\" and thus very hard to catch\nb. The experiments work OK, but they have so far found no neutrinos at all; not a single one\nc. All the neutrinos found in the experiments have been one of the other two types of neutrinos, not the electron neutrino that we expect coming from nuclear fusion in the Sun\nd. Now that they are working right, the experiments have found almost exactly the number of neutrinos that our models of the Sun have predicted should be coming\ne. The experiments have found only between 1/3 and 2/3 the number of neutrinos arriving from the Sun that our models predicted should be coming\n\n137. Which of the following is NOT an experiment that is searching for neutrinos coming from the Sun?\n\na. looking for radioactive argon atoms in a tank of cleaning fluid deep in an underground mine\nb. looking for changes in the Doppler shift of lines in the atmosphere of the Sun\nc. looking for radioactive gallium in a vast quantity of ordinary gallium\nd. looking with sensitive light meters in a giant vat of pure water deep underground in Japan\ne. all of the above are ways to search for neutrinos\n\n138. When an astronomer rambles on and on about the luminosity of a star she is studying, she is talking about:\n\na. what color the star is\nb. the total amount of mass in the star\nc. the star's apparent size (the size seen from Earth)\nd. how much energy the star gives off each second\ne. the elements she can see in the star's spectrum\n\n139. Two stars have the same luminosity, but star B is three times farther away from us than star A. Compared to star A, star B will look\n\na. three times brighter\nb. nine times brighter\nc. nine times fainter\nd. three times fainter\ne. just as bright as A\n\n141. An exhausted-looking astronomer comes off the mountain where his observatory is located and tells you he has been doing photometry. What has he been up to?\n\na. taking photos through bedroom windows in the valley below\nb. measuring the positions of stars on photographic plates taken over many years\nc. putting the light of stars through a spectrograph to measure what elements are present\nd. measuring the brightness of different stars\ne. counting the number of stars in different star clusters (groups)\n\n142. The first astronomer who did photometry in a systematic way (even though he did not have a telescope) was\n\na. Hipparchus\nb. Ptolemy\nc. Kepler\nd. Galileo\ne. Hubble\n\n144. Why are astronomers much more interested in the luminosity of a star than its apparent brightness?\n\na. because luminosity can be measured exactly, but apparent brightness can only be roughly estimated\nb. because the luminosity tells us how bright a star really is, while apparent brightness only tells us how bright it happens to look from Earth\nc. because the luminosity also tells us what elements the star is made of, while apparent brightness cannot tell us a star's chemical make-up\nd. because luminosity can tell us how bright it is inside the star, while apparent brightness only tells us about its outside layers\ne. you can't fool me, there is no difference between luminosity and apparent brightness; they are merely different terms for the same property of a star\n\n145. Which color star is likely to be the hottest?\n\na. red\nb. green\nc. blue-violet\nd. yellow\ne. orange\n\n146. Which type of star is the coolest (has the lowest surface temperature)?\n\na. O\nb. A\nc. M\nd. F\ne. G\n\n147. A team of astronomers takes spectra of thousands of different stars. The spectra show significant differences. The main reason the spectra of stars do not all look alike is that stars\n\na. are located in many different regions of the Milky Way\nb. have different temperatures\nc. are made of significantly different elements\nd. sometimes have atmospheres and sometimes do not\ne. change their spectra as they evolve, and so young stars have very different spectra from older ones\n\n148. If hydrogen is the most common element in the universe, why do we not see the lines of hydrogen in the spectra of the hottest stars?\n\na. in the hottest stars, hydrogen nuclei are forced to break apart into smaller nuclei\nb. in the hottest stars, all hydrogen in the star has quickly fused into helium\nc. in the hottest stars, hydrogen can quickly combine with oxygen to make H2O, whose spectrum consists of completely different lines\nd. in the hottest stars, the hydrogen atoms experience a huge Doppler shift, which moves the lines in the spectrum to a completely unrecognizable place\ne. in the hottest stars, hydrogen atoms are ionized, and so there are no electrons to produce lines in the spectrum\n\n149. Astronomers arrange the stars into groups called spectral classes (or types) according to the kinds of lines they find in their spectra. These spectral classes are arranged in order of decreasing:\n\na. decreasing surface temperature\nb. increasing mass\nc. increasing amount of hydrogen\nd. decreasing distance from us\ne. you can't fool me, there is no order to the spectral types (that's why the letters are not in alphabetical order)\n\n150. After days and days of work, a group of graduate students has finally measured the wavelengths of hundreds of lines in the spectrum of a distant star. If a number of the lines come from molecules such as titanium oxide, the star is likely to be which spectral type:\n\na. O\nb. B\nc. A\nd. M\ne. we need more information; lines from molecules can be found in stars of every spectral type\n\n151. The astronomer who, at the turn of the century, measured the spectra of hundreds of thousands of stars, leaving a catalog that astronomers used for the rest of the century, was:\n\na. Edwin Hubble\nb. Annie Cannon\nc. Cecilia Payne\nd. Joseph Fraunhofer\ne. James Lick\n\n152. A graduate student has spent a whole year doing a careful analysis of the spectrum of a star. While she has found lines from many elements, there was not a trace of the element helium in the spectra she has been analyzing. From this she can now conclude:\n\na. there is most likely no helium anywhere in the star\nb. all the helium must be in the core of the star; there is none of it in the outer regions\nc. since helium shows lines only in hot stars, this star must be relatively cool\nd. since helium is the kind of element that quickly bonds with others, all the helium in this star must be in the form of molecules\ne. the student was not surprised, because NO star ever shows any lines of helium\n\n153. At an astronomical conference, an astronomer gives a report on a star which has recently begun to interest astronomers because of hints that it may have a planet around it. In his report, the astronomer gives the speed with which this star is moving away from the Sun. How did the astronomer measure this speed?\n\na. by seeing how the luminosity of the star has been decreasing as it moves farther and farther away\nb. by seeing the star become much redder than it used to be\nc. by measuring the diameter of the star (which is easy to do) and noticing that it is getting smaller and smaller\nd. by looking at the Doppler shift in the lines of the star's spectrum\ne. the astronomer must be making up stories to impress his colleagues; there is no way to measure the speed with which stars move away or toward us.\n\n154. A star moving toward the Sun will show:\n\na. a shift in the spectral lines toward the blue end (as compared to the laboratory positions of these lines)\nb. a significant increase in its apparent brightness (magnitude)\nc. more and more helium lines as it approaches us\nd. a shift in the spectral lines toward the red end (as compared to the laboratory positions of these lines)\ne. no change that can be measured with our present-day instruments\n\n155. The motion of a star across the sky (perpendicular to our line of sight) is called its\n\na. radial velocity\nb. Doppler shift\nc. light travel time\nd. proper motion\ne. spectral type\n\n156. Imagine that a brilliant but quirky scientist in the biology department manages to put you in a deep freeze and you wake up in a million years. Which of the following statements about the sky you would see in that future time is correct?\n\na. all the stars and constellations would look exactly the same as they do now\nb. all the stars we can see in the sky today will have died in a million years\nc. if you could see them up close, almost all the stars in the sky today will have changed their color significantly in a million years\nd. because of proper motion, a number of the familiar constellations will look somewhat different in a million years\ne. at the present time, astronomers do not know enough about the universe to say what the sky might be like in a million years\n\n157. An astronomer whose secret hobby is riding merry-go-rounds has dedicated his career to finding the stars that rotate the most rapidly. But the stars are all very far away, so none of them can be seen to spin even when he looks through the largest telescopes. How then can he identify the stars that rotate rapidly?\n\na. all stars that rotate show a huge Doppler shift toward the blue end of the spectrum\nb. stars that rotate have a significantly lower luminosity than stars that do not rotate\nc. stars that rotate have much wider lines in their spectra than stars that do not\nd. stars that rotate bring the light atoms (like hydrogen) spinning up to their surfaces; so they can be identified by the elements they contain\ne. this astronomer better spend some more time enjoying his hobby, because he is not doing well at his job; there is no way we know about today to identify stars that rotate\n\n158. Most of the stars we can see with the unaided eye from Earth are\n\na. intrinsically fainter than the Sun\nb. very close to us (among the closest stars)\nc. more luminous (intrinsically brighter) than the Sun\nd. only visible to our eyes because they actually consist of three or more stars blending their light together\ne. undergoing some sort of explosion which makes their outer layers unusually bright\n\n159. Most of the really bright stars in our sky are NOT among the stars that are very close to us. Why then do they look so bright to us?\n\na. we see them in crowded regions of stars, which give us the impression that the stars there are brighter than they really are\nb. all the brightest stars are red, and red color is much easier to see against the black night sky\nc. these stars vary in brightness (flashing brighter and dimmer) and are thus easier to notice\nd. these stars are intrinsically so luminous, that they can easily be seen even across great distances\ne. actually, this is just an optical illusion; all stars are really the same brightness\n\n160. Some \"superstars\" give off more than 50,000 times the energy of the Sun. Why are there no such stars among the stars that are close to the Sun?\n\na. because conditions in the \"neighborhood\" of the Sun only permit low-mass (low luminosity) stars to form\nb. because such very luminous stars are extremely rare, and thus any small neighborhood in the Galaxy is unlikely to contain one of them\nc. because all stars in the vicinity of the Sun have planets, and planets rob a star of its brightness\nd. because such superstars only give off a lot of energy for a year or so, before they die\ne. because such superstars are really several hundred stars blending their light together (but so far away we can't distinguish individual stars); nearby stars are easy to separate\n\n161. The most common kinds of stars in the Galaxy have\n\na. low luminosity compared to the Sun\nb. spectra that show they contain mostly carbon\nc. enormous masses compared to the Sun\nd. diameters thousands of times greater than the Sun's\ne. a dozen or more stars in close orbit around them\n\n162. Which of the following characteristics of a single star (one that moves through space alone) is it difficult to measure directly?\n\na. its apparent brightness\nb. its temperature\nc. its chemical composition\nd. its mass\ne. you can't fool me, all of these are quite easy to measure directly\n\n163. Two stars that are physically associated (move together through space) are called\n\na. double stars\nb. main sequence stars\nc. brown dwarf pairs\nd. first contact stars\ne. binary stars\n\n164. Which of the following statements about spectroscopic binary stars is FALSE?\n\na. visually we can only see one star\nb. some of the lines in the spectrum are double, with the spacing changing over time\nc. an analysis of the ways the lines in the spectrum change allows us to calculate the star's distance directly\nd. we can use the spectrum to determine the sum of the masses of the two stars\ne. we can often use the changes in the positions of the spectral lines to measure the radial velocity of the stars in the system\n\n165. I am measuring the spectrum of the stars in a spectroscopic binary system. When one of the stars is moving toward the Earth in its orbit, we observe\n\na. that the lines in its spectrum get brighter\nb. that the lines in its spectrum merge with the lines of the other star\nc. that it is no longer possible to learn what elements are in the star\nd. that the lines in its spectrum show a blue-shift\ne. none of the above\n\n166. Which law do astronomers use to determine the masses of the stars in a spectroscopic binary system?\n\na. Wien's Law\nb. Kepler's Third Law\nc. Stefan-Boltzmann Law\nd. Hubble's Law\ne. Jenny Craig's Law\n\n167. Stars that do not have what it takes to succeed as a star (i.e. do not have enough mass to fuse hydrogen into helium at their centers) are called:\n\na. extras\nb. red giants\nc. spectroscopic stars\nd. brown dwarfs\ne. main sequence stars\n\n169. In 1995, astronomers identified a dim object called Gliese 229b, which appears to be a brown dwarf. Which of the following observations helped convince astronomers that they had indeed found an (elusive) brown dwarf?\n\na. its spectrum showed the molecule methane in the object's atmosphere\nb. its spectrum showed ionized helium (which can only exist at very cool temperatures)\nc. the star to which this object was a companion was also extremely dim\nd. it had an enormous radial velocity\ne. radio-telescope observations caught hints of the song \"Hi-ho, hi-ho, it's off to work we go...\"\n\n170. Why can astronomers not measure the diameters of stars directly?\n\na. stars are so bright, their light burns out all the delicate instruments we would use to measure their diameters\nb. stars change their diameters regularly, growing alternately larger and smaller\nc. stars are so far away, we cannot resolve (distinguish) their diameters\nd. stars are all in binary systems, and we can only see the combined diameter of both stars\ne. you can't fool me; measuring the diameter of any star is a relatively easy process\n\n171. For what type of star can astronomers measure the diameter with relative ease?\n\na. visual double stars\nb. white dwarf stars\nc. main sequence stars\nd. eclipsing binary stars\ne. any star that is not a brown dwarf\n\n172. An H-R Diagram plots the luminosity of stars against their:\n\na. mass\nb. diameter\nc. surface temperature\nd. age\ne. location in the sky\n\n173. In an H-R diagram, where can you check the spectral type of a star (whether it is an O type star or a G type star, for example)?\n\na. along the right (vertical axis)\nb. along the bottom (the horizontal axis)\nc. only in the red giant region\nd. only on the main sequence\ne. H-R diagrams have nothing to say about spectral types\n\n174. Who was the astronomer who is the \"H\" in H-R diagram?\n\na. Hubble\nb. Humason\nc. Hertzsprung\nd. Huggins\ne. Hoyle\n\n175. Ninety percent of all stars (if plotted on an H-R diagram) would fall into a region astronomers call:\n\na. the supergiant region\nb. the main sequence\nc. the white dwarf region\nd. the visual region\ne. the twilight zone\n\n176. Measurements show a certain star has a very high luminosity (100,000 x the Sun's) while its temperature is quite cool (3500\u00f8 K). How can this be?\n\na. it must be a main sequence star\nb. it must be quite small in size\nc. it must be quite large in size\nd. it must be brown dwarf and not a regular star\ne. this must be an error in observations; no such star can exist\n\n177. A white dwarf, compared to a main sequence star with the same mass, would always be:\n\na. larger in diameter\nb. smaller in diameter\nc. the same size in diameter\nd. younger in age\ne. less massive\n\n178. Imagine that powerful telescopes in the future give us a truly representative sampling of all the stars in the Sun's cosmic neighborhood. Where on the H-R diagram would most of the stars in our immediate vicinity lie?\n\na. in the upper right, among the supergiants\nb. in the upper left, among the bright main sequence stars\nc. in the middle of the main sequence, roughly where the Sun is\nd. in the lower left, among the white dwarfs\ne. in the lower right, among the least luminous main sequence stars\n\n179. A team of astronomers discovers one of the most massive stars ever found. If this star is just settling down in that stage of its life where it will be peacefully converting hydrogen to helium in its core, where will we find it on the H-R diagram?\n\na. among the supergiants, in the upper right\nb. a little bit below the Sun on the main sequence\nc. among the most brilliant of the white dwarfs, in the lower left\nd. near the very top of the main sequence, in the upper left\ne. it could be anywhere on the diagram; we would need more information to\ndetermine its place\n\n180. Astronomers identify the main sequence on the H-R diagram with what activity in the course of a star's life?\n\na. forming from a reservoir of cosmic material\nb. fusing hydrogen into helium in their cores\nc. letting go of a huge outer layer\nd. dying\ne. you can't fool me; so many stars are on the main sequence that there is no special stage in a star's life that can be identified with it\n\n181. Stars that lie in different places on the main sequence of the H-R diagram differ from each other mainly by having different:\n\na. compositions\nb. internal structure\nc. masses\nd. radial velocities\ne. ways that they formed\n\n182. One of your good friends who is on a diet asks you to point out the stars with the smallest mass on an H-R diagram that you are studying. Where are you sure to find the stars with the lowest mass on any H-R diagram?\n\na. among the white dwarfs\nb. among the stars at the top left of the main sequence\nc. among the stars at the bottom right of the main sequence\nd. among the supergiants\ne. stars with low mass can be located anywhere at all in the H-R diagram\n\n183. The apparent brightness of stars in general tells us nothing about their distances (i.e. we cannot assume that the dimmer stars are farther away.) In order for the apparent brightness of a star to be a good indicator of its distance, all the stars would have to be:\n\na. at the same distance\nb. the same composition\nc. the same luminosity\nd. by themselves instead of in binary or double-star systems\ne. a lot farther away than they presently are\n\n184. The original definition of a meter was\n\na. the distance from the extended index finger of the Emperor Napoleon to his nose\nb. one thousandth of the distance from Paris to London\nc. one billionth the distance from the Earth to the Sun\nd. one ten-millionth of the distance from the Earth's equator to its pole\ne. one thousandth the diameter of the town of Bayonne, New Jersey\n\n185. Kepler's Laws can give us the relative distance of objects in the solar system. To convert these relative distances into actual distances, we need to:\n\na. measure the mass of the Sun\nb. measure the size of the Earth\nc. measure the distance directly to any object orbiting the Sun\nd. measure the length of the year exactly\ne. measure the time it takes for the Earth to spin once on its axis\n\n186. An astronomical unit is:\n\na. the distance to the nearest star\nb. the distance covered by light in one year\nc. the distance covered by light in one month\nd. the time it takes for the solar system to turn once on its axis\ne. the average distance between the Earth and the Sun\n\n187. Today, astronomers can measure distances directly to worlds like Venus, Mars, the Moon, or the satellites of Jupiter by\n\na. bouncing radar beams off them\nb. using x-ray telescopes\nc. using the Hubble Space Telescope to triangulate with\nd. using Cepheid variable stars that lie behind the planets\ne. sending graduate students out with very long tape measures\n\n188. Why did it take astronomers until 1838 to measure the parallax of the stars?\n\na. because most stars are too faint to see without a good telescope\nb. because the stars are so far away that their annual shift of position in the sky is too small to see without a telescope\nc. because detecting parallax requires measuring a spectrum, which only became possible in the 1830's\nd. because cepheid variable stars had not been discovered earlier\ne. because no one before then could conceive of the Earth moving around the Sun\n\n189. As astronomers use the term, the parallax of a star is\n\na. one half of the Doppler shift due to its radial velocity\nb. always equal to 1 AU\nc. one half the angle that a star shifts when seen from opposite sides of the Earth's orbit\nd. the time it takes a Cepheid variable star to go through one cycle of its brightness changes\ne. the time it takes for a star to move one second of arc of proper motion\n\n190. How far away would a star with a parallax of 0.2 arcsec be from us?\n\na. 2 parsecs\nb. 5 parsecs\nc. 0.2 parsecs\nd. 0.5 parsecs\ne. we need more information to answer this question\n\n191. If a star is 10 parsecs away, how long ago did the light we see from it tonight begins its journey toward us?\n\na. 10 years\nb. 0.1 years\nc. 10,000 years\nd. 32.6 years\ne. 6100 years\n\n192. The instrument astronomers have been using to make the most precise measurements of stellar parallax we have ever had is\n\na. the Keck telescope in Hawaii\nb. the Very Large Array of radio telescopes\nc. the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory\nd. the Hipparcos satellite\ne. a swimming-pool sized vat of cleaning fluid deep in the shaft of a gold mine\n\n193. An astronomer is observing a single star (and one which does not vary) which she knows is located about 40 LY away. What is the most likely method she or her colleagues used to obtain that distance?\n\na. bouncing radar beams off the star\nb. measuring the star's parallax\nc. the period-luminosity relationship\nd. Kepler's laws\ne. Hubble's law\n\n194. A type of star that has turned out to be extremely useful for measuring distances is\n\na. the eclipsing binaries\nb. the Cepheid variables\nc. the main sequence stars\nd. the white dwarf stars\ne. the stars that lie in the constellation of Orion\n\n195. A light curve for a star measures how its brightness changes with\n\na. time\nb. distance\nc. mass\nd. radial velocity\ne. age\n\n196. How do astronomers know that pulsating variable stars are actually expanding and contracting in diameter?\n\na. it is clear just by looking at the light curve\nb. they discover this by looking at an H-R diagram\nc. they can measure a regularly varying Doppler shift in the spectral lines\nd. they can measure the star's changing pull on a companion star around it\ne. astronomers are just guessing; at the distances of the stars, there is no way to show that stars are expanding and contracting\n\n197. Why do Cepheid variables have that strange name?\n\na. they were discovered by an astronomer named George Cepheid\nb. the first star discovered to be this kind of variable had the Latin name Cepheidus\nc. the word Cepheid means changing in brightness in ancient Greek\nd. the first such variable was discovered in a constellation called Cepheus\ne. the astronomer who discovered them had a dog named Ceffie\n\n198. The period-luminosity relationship for Cepheid variables was discovered by\n\na. John Goodricke\nb. Henrietta Leavitt\nc. Edward Pickering\nd. Henry Norris Russell\ne. Edwin Hubble\n\n199. The measurement of cosmic distances was helped tremendously by the discovery, in the early part of the 20th century, that in Cepheid variable stars, the average luminosity was related to:\n\na. their radial velocity\nb. the abundance of hydrogen in their atmospheres\nc. their distance from the Sun\nd. the length of time they took to vary\ne. their parallax\n\n200. Which of the following stars is a Cepheid variable?\n\na. Sirius\nb. Betelgeuse\nc. Rigel\nd. Mizar\ne. Polaris",

    "prompt": "Tony Marston's Blog About software development, PHP and OOP\n\nUsing object composition for \"has-a\" relationships is not such a good idea\n\nPosted on 3rd November 2015 by Tony Marston\n\n\nI recently came across an article called Increasing complexity one entity at a time which identified a problem with some people's approach to Object Oriented Programming (OOP). This problem is caused by a certain practice which most OO programmers regard as being standard but which I regard as a complete Pile Of Poo (POP). This is the practice of using inheritance for \"is-a\" relationships and object composition for \"has-a\" relationships. This is described in Inheritance, composition and the meaning of \"is a\" which contains the following statement:\n\nI'm guessing most of us heard that inheritance is for is-a relationships and composition is for has-a relationships one time or another.\n\nThis message is echoed in Java 101 primer: Composition and inheritance which contains the following statement:\n\nIn Java 101: Inheritance in Java, Part 1 you learned how to leverage inheritance for code reuse, by establishing is-a relationships between classes. This free Java 101 primer focuses on composition, a closely related programming technique that is used to establish has-a relationships instead.\n\nThe whole idea of \"is-a\" being implemented via inheritance and \"has-a\" being implemented via object composition is completely alien to me. In fact, the whole idea of Object Oriented Design (OOD) and all that it entails is something which I avoid like the plague and wouldn't touch with a barge pole. This is not because I am an idiot or have been badly trained, but because of the 20+ years of training and experience in the design and construction of database applications for the enterprise which I accumulated before moving to a language which supported OO. Those decades of experience taught me the following:\n\nMost of this experience was spent working for software houses where we had to respond to a customer's Specification Of Requirements (SOR) with an outline design as well as cost and time estimates. When we won the business we then had to deliver the goods, and I can honestly say that none of the systems that I designed and built ever failed, nor did any go over budget or over time (at least, not by a significant amount). Having designed and built many systems in several non-OO languages using hierarchical, network and relational databases I became quite proficient at data analysis and data normalisation. Building one new system after another also taught me the value of building code libraries which could be used in multiple applications. Over a period of time these libraries morphed into full-blown frameworks, the first of which I wrote in COBOL which I later rewrote in UNIFACE and then PHP.\n\nWhat is Object Oriented Programming?\n\nI started to use PHP in 2002, but before I could make proper use of its OO capabilities I first had to find out what OO actually meant and how the language could help me write programs which were object oriented. My research led me to the following definition:\n\nObject Oriented Programming is programming which is oriented around objects, thus taking advantage of Encapsulation, Polymorphism, and Inheritance to increase code reuse and decrease code maintenance.\n\nYou may think that OO requires more than that, but Alan Kay (who invented the term \"object oriented\") would disagree. In addition, Bjarne Stroustrup (who designed and implemented the C++ programming language), provides this broad definition of the term \"Object Oriented\" in section 3 of his paper called Why C++ is not just an Object Oriented Programming Language:\n\nA language or technique is object-oriented if and only if it directly supports:\n  1. Abstraction - providing some form of classes and objects.\n  2. Inheritance - providing the ability to build new abstractions out of existing ones.\n  3. Runtime polymorphism - providing some form of runtime binding.\n\nLater versions of various OO languages have added more features, and some people seem to think that it is these additional features which decide if a language is OO or not. I totally disagree for the reasons stated in What OOP is Not, as well as this list of optional OO features for which I have found no use. It would be like saying that a car is not a car unless it has climate control and satnav. Those are optional extras, not the distinguishing features, and not using them does not make your code not OO. It would also be incorrect to say that a car is a car because it has wheels. Having wheels does not make something a car - a pram has wheels, but that does not make it a car, so having wheels is not a distinguishing feature.\n\nA definition which contains terms is pretty worthless unless you also have a description of what those terms actually mean, so these are the definitions of those terms which I use:\n\n\nAll the entities in the business/domain layer are database tables, so I have a separate class for each table.\n\nEncapsulation The act of placing an entity's data and the operations that perform on that data in the same class. The class then becomes the 'capsule' or container for both the data and the operations.\n\nNote that this requires ALL the properties and ALL the methods to be placed in the SAME class. Breaking a single class into smaller classes so that the count of methods in any one class does not exceed an arbitrary number is therefore a bad idea as it violates encapsulation and makes the system harder to read and understand. It would also decrease cohesion and increase coupling which would be the exact opposite of what should be achieved.\n\n\n\nAll the Model classes in the business/domain layer are database tables, so in my approach each concrete table class inherits from an abstract table class.\n\nPolymorphism Same interface, different implementation. The ability to substitute one class for another. This means that different classes may contain the same method signatures, but the result which is returned by a particular method will be different as the code behind that method (the implementation) is different in each class.\n\n\nEach of my 40 reusable Controllers interacts with the 300+ business/domain layer (Model) classes via methods defined in the abstract table class, which means that any Controller can access any Model. Each Controller contains a particular set of method calls on an unknown Model, and the results of each method call varies from one Model to another. The identity of the Model is not hard-coded into any Controller, it is passed to it at runtime using a mechanism known as Dependency Injection.\n\nSome programmers try to claim that PHP is not an OO language, but as even PHP4 met the requirements that were identified by the man who invented the term I consider this claim to have zero merit.\n\nWhat entities can be turned into classes?\n\nOOP requires the definition of classes which can be turned into objects at runtime. The first problem is therefore identifying those entities with which your application is expected to communicate.\n\nIn his article How to write testable code the author describes three main categories of object that may appear in a computer system:\n\nIt may not be obvious to the beginner, but it is considered very bad form to put all your code into a single class, just as it is considered bad form to put all your data into a single database table. The code that you write for a database application can be broken down into three distinct categories: Presentation/GUI logic, Business/Domain logic and Data Access logic. This is not just my opinion, it is echoed in the following articles:\n\nThis produces the architecture which is shown in Figure 1:\n\nFigure 1 - The 3-Tier Architecture\n\n\nMost of today's developers are more familiar with the MVC architecture which is shown in Figure 2:\n\nFigure 2 - The Model-View-Controller structure\n\nmodel-view-controller-01 (3K)\n\nWhile similar, these two architectural patterns are not the same, but they do overlap and can exist together, as shown in figure 3:\n\nFigure 3 - MVC plus 3 Tier Architecture\n\nmodel-view-controller-03a (5K)\n\nIt is a combination of these two architectures which I used in my open source RADICORE framework, the full structure diagram of which is shown in Figure 4:\n\nFigure 4 - RADICORE framework structure\n\nComponent Script Controller Script Database Table Class Abstract Table Class Validation Class DML Class Screen Structure Script XML file XSL Stylesheet XSL Transformation Process HTML Output CSS File Audit Class Workflow Engine View Object Presentation layer Business layer Data Access layer infrastructure-05 (13K)\n\nNote that in the above diagram each of the numbered components is a clickable link.\n\nThe classes which are the main topic of this article are those which contain the business logic of the application and which reside in what can be called the Business layer, the Domain layer or the Model layer. The components in the other layers will be discussed later on.\n\nUsing database tables as entities\n\nOne of the big selling points of OOP is that you can model the real world!, but a lot of developers fail to realise that you do not model the whole of the real world, only those parts in which you are actually interested. Different entities in the real world may have exotic sets of methods (also known as operations, functions or actions) and properties (also known as attributes, variables or data), but you need only create software models which contain those methods and properties which are actually relevant to your application.\n\nThis brings me to my next point. You may be building an Order Processing application that deals with entities such as Customers, Products and Sales Orders, so the novice designer will start by making a list of all the methods and properties of people (who are customers), products (the items being sold) and sales orders (agreements to purchase). IMHO this is a BIG mistake. A Person, for example, may have methods such as \"stand\", \"sit\", \"walk\" and \"run\" and properties such as \"blue eyes\", \"brown hair\", \"6 foot tall\" and \"weighs 12 stone\" but none of these have ever been relevant in any Order Processing application that I have written. They usually restrict themselves to \"name\", \"postal address\" and \"email address\". Similarly different physical products may have oodles of methods and properties which are totally ignored except for \"identity\", \"description\" and \"price\". When it comes to Sales Orders, these never exist physically in the real world. In pre-computer days all sales orders were filled out on paper, but nowadays sales orders are rarely printed, if ever. They are merely stored as bits and bytes in a computer system.\n\nAn Order Processing application, or indeed ANY database application, does not therefore interface with any entities in the real world, it only interfaces with tables in a database, so it should not be a big step to regard each database table as an entity from which you can create a class. When I first published this idea I was immediately branded as a heretic as every competent programmer knows that having a separate class for each database table is not good OO. Another reason was phrased as follows:\n\nI understand the point of reusing code to generate SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE statements, but you can do that without having to create a class for every table you have. Say I wanted to talk to the table 'cars'. I'd compose an object by creating an instance of a Table class and add rules represented as objects to it. I think that if you ask some good designers they will tell you that an approach which uses instances of a single Table class is better than one which requires the declaration of a new class for each new table.\n\nEach database table has its own data structure and its own methods, therefore surely qualifies for its own class. The idea of having an empty table class into which I can later inject the data structure, the business rules and the methods seems to me to be an overly complex way of doing such a simple thing - I would have to hold the data structure, business rules and methods somewhere in the application before I could inject them into an empty table object in order to make a usable object. By making this somewhere a class which inherits from the abstract/empty class I don't have to inject anything anywhere - all I have to do is instantiate this somewhere class and I instantly have a usable object without the need for any extra code to perform the injection. Also, if you look at the definition of a class you will see that it says A class is a blueprint, or prototype, that defines the variables and the methods common to all objects (entities) of a certain kind. If you look at the DDL for a database table then surely this qualifies as the \"blueprint\" for every record that will be written to that table?\n\nLater on the same critic wrote:\n\nAbstract concepts are classes, their instances are objects. IMO The table 'cars' is not an abstract concept but an object in the world.\n\nThat is precisely why I have an abstract table class which specifies the methods and properties for an unspecified database table, and a separate concrete class for each actual database table which inherits from this abstract class. My main application has over 300 tables, so that's a lot of inheritance.\n\nSomebody once told me:\n\nIf you have one class per database table you are relegating each class to being no more than a simple transport mechanism for moving data between the database and the user interface. It is supposed to be more complicated than that.\n\nWhy on earth should it be more complicated than that? What you have described is the basic pattern for every user transaction in every database application. Data moves between the User Interface (UI) and the database by passing through the business/domain layer where the business rules are processed. All I have done is build on that pattern.\n\nSurely all I am doing is following the KISS principle. There is nothing inherently wrong with this, just as there is nothing inherently right about making things more complicated than they need be.\n\nI have been building database applications for several decades in several different languages, and in that time I have built thousands of programs. Every one of these, regardless of which business domain they are in, follows the same pattern in that they perform one or more CRUD operations on one or more database tables aided by a screen (which nowadays is HTML) on the client device. This part of the program's functionality, the moving of data between the client device and the database, is so similar that it can be provided using boilerplate code which can, in turn, be provided by the framework. Every complicated program starts off by being a simple program which can be expanded by adding business rules which cannot be covered by the framework. The standard code is provided by a series of Template Methods which are defined within an abstract table class. This then allows any business rules to be included in any table subclass simply by adding the necessary code into any of the predefined hook methods. The standard, basic functionality is provided by the framework while the complicated business rules are added by the programmer.\n\nI have been told many times that having one class per database table is simply not done. If this is the case then why does Martin Fowler, the author of Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture, have several design patterns for it? Take a look at Table Data Gateway, Row Data Gateway, Class Table Inheritance and Concrete Table Inheritance. Is he wrong, or are you? In his article OrmHate he states the following:\n\n\nNote that the words or even eliminate are mine. Later in the same article he also says:\n\n\nI have been building database applications for the enterprise for several decades in several languages, and I have personally designed and built many thousands of user transactions. No matter how complex an individual transaction may be, it always involves performing one or more CRUD operations on one or more database tables. All I have done is adapt my procedural programming method to encapsulate the knowledge of each database table in its own class, then use inheritance and polymorphism to increase code reuse and decrease code maintenance. This is supposed to be what OOP is all about, so how can I be wrong? In addition, because my class structures and database structures are always kept in sync I do not have any mapping code or any mapping problems.\n\nWhat is Object Composition?\n\nAccording to this wikipedia article the meaning of Object Composition is as follows:\n\n\nIn the case of a class which has methods (operations) and properties (data), it could be than one of those properties is more than a single value but a collection of multiple values which, following the rules of normalisation, are moved to their own table in the database. This property is then represented as another class which can only be accessed through its parent. In this case the child entity exists in a \"has-a\" relationship with its parent, as in the parent P has a child C. In the article Increasing complexity one entity at a time the author gives an example where there is a Company entity and where each company \"has-a\" list of Contacts and \"has-a\" list of Engagements. The only way to access any Contact or Engagement data is to go through the Company object. This arrangement can be expressed in the diagram shown as Figure 5:\n\nFigure 5 - a Composite Object\n\nobject-composition-001 (1K)\n\nIn this example the calling object, which is usually a controller in the MVC design pattern, cannot access either the Contact or Engagement data without going through the Company object. This means that the controller must first instantiate an instance of Company which then itself instantiates instances of both Contact and Engagement. It then has to call a method on the Company object to get the data it wants, which implies that there must be separate methods for accessing Company data, Contact data and Engagement data.\n\nThis whole design perplexes me. This is not something that I would ever have dreamt up myself as the SQL language allows me to access a table directly without having to go through another table. It does not matter how many parent or child relations exist for a table, I can always access that table without referring to any of its parents or children. Although it is possible to have different use cases which access particular combinations of tables in particular ways, it is surely a function of the use case to identify which combination is actually required, and to be able to access each table in a polymorphic manner. The idea of object composition strikes me as being a clear violation of the KISS principle. When I first heard about this idea and read its details the first thought that ran through my mind was Who dreamt up this pile of poo? As a developer with decades of experience in the design and building of database applications I therefore choose to follow the Table Oriented Programming approach instead of that abomination called Object Oriented Design.\n\nWhen designing a database using the well established rules of Data Normalisation the Company, Contact and Engagement entities will be represented as separate tables in the database. Where there is a relationship between two tables this is indicated by having a foreign key on the child table which refers back to the primary key on the parent table. This parent-child relationship is often referred to as a one-to-many relationship as a single instance of parent/one table can have multiple associated instances on the child/many table. In Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD) this relationship is shown as a line connecting the two tables with either a crows foot or an arrow head to indicate which table is the child/many in that relationship. In a database the three entities shown in Figure 5 would be shown differently, as in Figure 6:\n\nFigure 6 - Entity Relationship Diagram\n\nobject-composition-002 (1K)\n\nThose of you who know SQL and how databases work will also be aware of the following facts:\n\nObject composition would therefore present the following obstacles:\n\nObject Composition is slow to run\n\nMany years ago I read a post in a newsgroup where a developer complained that his code was very slow. He had built an application for a school which dealt with entities such as Classroom, Teacher and Student. It also had Subject which was subdivided into Lessons, and Schedule which is an instance of a Teacher giving a Lesson to a group of Students in a particular Classroom on a particular date and time. Following the rules of object composition he had created a School class which had properties for each of these \"has-a\" entities. When he instantiated the School object this read everything from the database in order to populate each of these child objects. When the volume of data was quite small it ran reasonably quickly, but as he added more and more data it got slower and slower, and he couldn't understand why. His complaint to the newsgroup was I have followed the rules concerning object composition, so why is my software so slow?\n\nThe first thing he did wrong was to use object composition. The second thing that he did wrong was to implement it badly.\n\nThe idea that you should read all your data into a single object just in case it is needed is not a good idea. Those of us with practical experience know that you only read the data that you need when you actually need it. This philosophy is known as just in time.\n\nI actually wrote my own version of a Classroom Scheduling system way back in 2004 which has exactly the same entities but does not have any performance problems. You can run this code now for yourself by visiting the RADICORE demonstration page, logging on as \"demo\" and selecting the PROTO menu followed by the CLASSROOM option. This works because I don't use object composition and can access each table's class without going through a parent class, and because each user transaction only reads that data from the database that it actually needs in order to service the current request.\n\nHe follows the rules and creates crap software. I disobey the rules and create good software. What does this tell you about those rules?\n\nObject Composition does not scale\n\nI am quite familiar with, and totally agree with, the idea that once you have identified an entity (something which has properties and methods) that needs to be accessed in your application then you should create a class which encapsulates the properties and methods of that entity. Note that this means ALL the properties and ALL the methods of that entity should go into a SINGLE class. The idea that you should split some of these methods or properties off into separate and smaller classes simply because the count exceeds an arbitrary number is an idea that never occurred to me, and now that I know that it exists I am quite happy to ignore it. However, where one of those properties is so complex that it goes beyond being a single value and requires its own table in the database, then I treat that property as a totally separate entity which requires its own independent class.\n\nFigure 6 shows a small ERD, but in a large enterprise application the number of tables and relationships can be much, much larger. My own ERP application, for example, is based on the database designs which can be found in Len Silverston's Data Model Resource Book. A diagram of a subset of the PARTY database is shown in Figure 7, the PRODUCT database is shown in Figure 8, and the ORDER database is shown in Figure 9.\n\nFigure 7 - the PARTY database\n\nobject-composition-003 (5K)\n\nNote that this design caters for organisations as well as people, and customers as well as suppliers.\n\nA subset of the PRODUCT database is shown in Figure 8:\n\nFigure 8 - the PRODUCT database\n\nobject-composition-004 (5K)\n\nAs you should see there is a relationship between the PARTY table and the PRODUCT table via the PRODUCT_SUPPLIER table, so should this be a child in the PARTY class or the PRODUCT class? Should I have a different version of the PRODUCT_SUPPLIER class for each of its parents?\n\nA subset of the ORDER database is shown in Figure 9:\n\nFigure 9 - the ORDER database\n\nobject-composition-005 (4K)\n\nAs you can see it is just not possible to have a single table for CUSTOMER, PRODUCT and ORDER. They each require such a diverse collection of data that, following the rules of Data Normalisation, they actually require a large collection of tables, large enough to warrant an entire database to themselves. Just as you would not put all that data into a single table I do not see why you should put all the programming logic for those tables into a single class. Each table has its own schema, its own blueprint, its own business rules, so as far as I am concerned it qualifies for its own class. That is the basis on which I built my RADICORE framework in 2002, and as it has worked out so well I see no reason to change it.\n\nBy coincidence this actually conforms to the idea that with OOD you use inheritance for each \"is-a\" relationship. As each of my entities is a database table it therefore inherits from my abstract table class.\n\nObject Composition increases coupling\n\nWhenever you have a call from one module/component to another the two modules are said to be coupled. Coupling describes how the two modules interact. It describes the degree of mutual interdependence and the degree of interaction between them. Lower coupling is better. Low coupling tends to create more reusable methods. Tightly coupled systems tend to exhibit the following developmental characteristics, which are often seen as disadvantages:\n\nIf you create a new table in the database which happens to be the child of an existing table, then you have to make the following changes:\n\nObject Composition decreases cohesion\n\nCohesion describes the contents of a module, the degree to which the responsibilities of a single module/component form a meaningful unit, and the degree of interaction within a module. It is a measure of the strength of association or the functional relatedness of the elements inside a module. Modules with high cohesion are preferable because high cohesion is associated with desirable traits such as robustness, reliability, reusability, extendability, and understandability whereas low cohesion is associated with undesirable traits such as being difficult to maintain, difficult to test, difficult to reuse, difficult to extend, and even difficult to understand.\n\nFor example, in my framework I have separate View components which formats application data into HTML, PDF and CSV. Each format requires processing which totally unconnected with that required for the other formats, so it makes sense to keep the code for each format in its own class.\n\nHaving a separate class for each database table, and to be able to access that class without having to go through another class, means that each class is limited to the business rules of a single table. Mixing the business rules for several tables in a single class is a practice that I have learned to avoid. Each table is a separate entity in the database, so it should be a separate entity in the software and it should be able to be accessed as a separate entity.\n\nObject Composition decreases polymorphism\n\nPolymorphism is the ability to call the same method on a number of different classes. This makes the calling module reusable as the identity of the dependent module can be supplied at runtime, usually through a mechanism known as dependency injection, and the method call will still work, although the code which is executed will be different. If a method is only available on a single object then there is no opportunity for polymorphism and no opportunity for reusability. By decreasing the reusability of your code you are therefore violating one of the aims of OOP which is increased reusability. If I can only access the Contact table by going through the Company table then the controller must use code such as the following:\n\nrequire 'classes/';\n$company = new Company;\n$result = $company->getContactData();\n$result = $company->contact->getData();\n\nThis code is tightly coupled and not reusable. Compare this with the following code:\n\nrequire 'classes/$';\n$dbobject = new $table_id;\n$result = $dbobject->getData($where);\n\nThis allows to value of $table_id to be set to any table in the database, and the method call will then perform that operation on that table. In my framework I have 40 controllers, one for each Transaction Pattern, that can be used with any Model class in the Business layer by virtue of the fact that the method names are defined in the abstract class which is inherited by each Model class. As my main enterprise application has 300 database tables, this provides the opportunity for 12,000 (300 x 40) polymorphic combinations. If your methodology does not provide that level of reusability then I would strongly suggest that you re-evaluate your methodology as it is failing to deliver what OOP was supposed to deliver.\n\nOne Controller per Use Case, not per Entity\n\nAnother idea which I came across several years after building my framework is that when implementing the MVC design pattern you are supposed to have a separate Controller class for each Model class, and this this single Controller is supposed to be able to deal with every possible Use Case.\n\nA Use Case is defined as:\n\na list of action or event steps, typically defining the interactions between a role/actor and a system, to achieve a goal.\n\nIn my universe, which existed before this term was invented, these things called \"use cases\" were known as \"transactions\" within a Transaction Processing System. This was later changed to User Transaction or Business Transaction in order to differentiate it from a Database Transaction as some user transactions do not actually involve updating the database, so using a COMMIT/ROLLBACK would not be relevant. In my RADICORE framework the term \"user transactions\" has been shortened to task, and each task, which performs one of the LIST, SEARCH, INSERT, ENQUIRE, UPDATE or DELETE operations shown in Figure 10, can be selected by a user either from a menu button or a navigation button. Each task has its own component script in the file system which identifies which Model, View and Controller to use.\n\nSome people create complex use cases by combining several separate operations into one, such as \"show a SEARCH screen where the user can enter filters, then show a LIST screen displaying the records which match those filters, allow the user to select a record and then show an ENQUIRE screen which displays all the details for that record\". Each of the SEARCH, LIST and ENQUIRE screens should be developed as separate transactions which can be run one after the other in any combination. The idea of predefining which combinations are allowed, and having a separate use case for each combination, is an alien concept to me.\n\nThe idea of having a single controller which can handle multiple operations is also an idea which I shot down in flames several decades ago. Each operation requires its own pieces of program logic, therefore in order to execute a single operation the controller must contain additional code which identifies which pieces of code need to be included or excluded for that particular operation. Problems arise when a piece of code gets executed when it should not, or does not get executed when it should. This becomes a bigger problem when you try to introduce Role Based Access Control in order to limit particular operations to particular users. I solved this problem in 1985 when I built my first development framework in COBOL by having each user transaction (use case) developed as a separate piece of code which had its own entry on the M-TRAN table in the database. Each user had an entry on the M-USER table, and a particular user could only access a particular transaction if there was a corresponding entry on the D-TRAN-USER table. This meant that there was no need for any code inside a transaction which checked to see if a particular user could or could not access a piece of logic as the checking could now be performed by the framework before the transaction was run and not after it had started. Each transaction was activated by pressing a button on a screen, and the framework was programmed not to display those buttons for which the current user did not have access. If the user could not see the button to activate a transaction then he could not run that transaction. How simple is that?\n\nThere are some programmers who seem to think that a Controller can only ever access a single Model, but this rule does not exist in my universe. The author of Increasing complexity one entity at a time seems to agree with me as in the paragraph titled Fixing the problem (2nd solution) he says the following:\n\nI then decided to make multiple calls from my pages. If a page needed a company, a list of contacts and a list of engagements related to that company, I would make three calls from the page. This decision made all the \"read\" objects go away and still kept my code very simple.\n\nIf he says it's OK then how can it possibly be wrong?\n\nGeneric methods, not special methods for each Use Case\n\nIn his article Objects as Contracts for Behaviour Mathias Verraes argues against the following comment:\n\nObjects should just be bags of state and nothing more. An invoice does not pay itself. An appointment does not reschedule itself. and appointment.reschedule(aDate) do not match the real world. Something on the outside drives the action. A service of some kind should do the paying and the rescheduling, and then update the state of those objects: invoice.setPaidAmount(anAmount) and appointment.setDate(aDate). By consequence, not in the objects, but the services should contain the business logic.\n\nHis argument is stated as follows:\n\n\nEncapsulation of state and behaviour is the core idea behind objects.\n\nI disagree with both of these opinions for the simple reason that they both require specific methods to be inserted into the class, and this in turn requires the controller which calls that object to be coded with those specific methods. By doing this you have instantly removed any reusability from that controller as it can only be used on an object which contains those methods. By using specific methods instead of generic methods you have disabled any opportunity for reuse via polymorphism.\n\nHow is it possible to achieve these results without using specialised methods? You have to remember that in a database application the entities called INVOICE and APPOINTMENT are both database tables, and the only operations that can be performed on a database table are Create, Read, Update and Delete. In my framework these operations are built into my abstract table class which is inherited by every concrete table (Model) class. Every one of my 40 page controllers communicates with its Model by using these generic methods, which means that every one of those page controllers is capable of being used with any of my 300+ table classes. Thus by opening up the door to polymorphism I have created a huge amount of reusable code, and as this is supposed to be one of the objectives of OOP it must be a good idea.\n\nHow is it possible to perform these operations by calling generic methods? You should realise that in an application each use case is implemented as a user transaction (task) which can be selected from a menu. Each task consists of a Controller which calls a Model which in turn calls a DAO to update the database. So for each use case you need to identify exactly what database operations are needed to achieve the desired result.\n\nIn order to implement the use case \"add a payment to an invoice\" it is not as simple as updating a single column in the INVOICE table. In a properly designed system you must allow for payments of different types (credit card, cheque, etc). You must also be able to deal with partial as well as full payments, and provide the ability to either void or refund a payment. This means that all payments are held on their own PAYMENT table while the invoice balance - the difference between the invoice amount and any payments - is held on the INVOICE table. In order to complete this use case the user transaction must achieve the following:\n\n  1. Add a record to the PAYMENT table.\n  2. Update the INVOICE record with the new balance.\n\nPoint #1 can be done by creating a task which combines the standard ADD 1 pattern and the PAYMENT table. This will use the generic insertRecord() method to add a record to the PAYMENT table, such as in the following:\n\n$table_id = 'payment';\nrequire \"classes/$\";\n$dbobject = new $table_id;\n$result = $dbobject->insertRecord($_POST);\nif ($dbobject->errors) {\n    $errors = array_merge($errors, $dbobject->errors);\n} else {\n} // if\n\nPoint #2 can be achieved by inserting the following code into the _cm_post_insertRecord() method of the PAYMENT class:\n\nfunction _cm_post_insertRecord ($fieldarray)\n// perform custom processing after database record has been inserted.\n    $dbobject = RDCsingleton::getInstance('invoice');\n    $pkey['invoice_id'] = $fieldarray['invoice_id'];\n    $result = $dbobject->updateRecord($pkey);\n    if ($dbobject->errors) {\n        $this->errors = array_merge($this->errors, $dbobject->errors);\n    } // if\n\n    return $fieldarray;\n} // _cm_post_insertRecord\n\nYou may notice that this code does not actually identify which columns on the INVOICE table need to be updated with what values. This is because the updateRecord() method contains a call to the _cm_pre_updateRecord() method, and this method in the INVOICE class contains code similar to the following:\n\nfunction _cm_pre_updateRecord ($fieldarray)\n// perform custom processing before database record is updated.\n    $where = array2where($fieldarray, $this->getPkeyNames());\n\n    $dbobject = RDCsingleton::getInstance('payment');\n    $fieldarray['total_paid'] = $dbobject->getCount(\"SELECT SUM(payment_amount)) FROM payment WHERE $where\");\n    $fieldarray['balance'] = $fieldarray['invoice_amount'] - $fieldarray['total_paid'];\n    return $fieldarray;\n} // _cm_pre_updateRecord\n\nNotice that I do not bother with a special updateBalance() method as I want the balance to be automatically updated in every update operation, and this can be done with the generic updateRecord() method.\n\nIn order to implement the use case \"reschedule an appointment\" this could be as simple as updating the appointment_date column on the APPOINTMENT table, in which case all you need to do is create a task which combines the standard UPDATE 1 pattern and the APPOINTMENT table. Note that this will allow any column except for the primary key to be updated.\n\nBy working with the fact that I am updating a relational database, and breaking down each use case into specific database operations, I am able to perform each of those operations with a combination of pre-written and reusable generic code plus the addition of custom code in the relevant custom methods. This achieves the necessary results, but with far less effort, so how can it possibly be wrong?\n\nServices are for framework logic, not business logic.\n\nIn What entities can be turned into classes? I identified two categories for objects - entities (domain objects) and services. The main difference between the two is that entities have state which can persist while services do not.\n\nA problem arises because some programmers have great difficulty in answering these two questions:\n\n  1. What logic belongs in a Domain object?\n  2. What logic belongs in a Service object?\n\nAs far as I am concerned any business logic which is specific to a single entity belongs in the class which represents that entity, and these classes belong in the Domain/Business layer. This, after all, is what encapsulation is all about. However, in any application there will be some logic that will need to be performed on the data for many entities, not just a specific entity, and it is this logic that can safely be put into separate service objects.\n\nIn order to put this idea into practice you must start with a multi-layer architecture. My own framework for example, is a combination of the 3-Tier Architecture and the MVC Design Pattern as it contains Models, Views, Controllers and Data Access Objects.\n\nAll application logic is contained within the Domain/Business layer in the form of Model classes which are generated by the developer with the help of the Data Dictionary. All Views, Controllers and DAOs are application-agnostic as they do not contain any application logic, only general-purpose framework logic. They are supplied within the framework, can work with any domain object, and do not have to be touched by the developer, therefore can be regarded as services.\n\nHow does my methodology work?\n\nI am often asked the question I have been taught that there is only one way to do OO, and you are not following that way, so how can it possibly work?. When I explain that I design my database first and then build the software around the database design, as taught in the Jackson Structured Programming course I attended decades ago, I am then told But that's not how it's supposed to be done! One indignant OO \"expert\" went so far as to tell me I tried that approach once, and I couldn't get it to work. That just tells me that his implementation was seriously flawed, and if he cannot achieve what generations of programmers have been doing for decades, then what does that say about his programming skills?\n\nI had been writing database applications in several non-OO languages for several decades before I switched to PHP and its OO capabilities in 2002, so I wanted to continue doing what had worked successfully till then, but to take advantage of encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism in order to increase code reuse and decrease maintenance. This, after all, is supposed to be what OO is all about.\n\nIt is only after writing large numbers of programs which maintain the contents of large numbers of database tables that you begin to see patterns emerging, and it is the ability to turn these patterns into reusable code which is the mark of a good programmer. But when do these patterns start to emerge?\n\n1st framework in COBOL\n\nEven in my COBOL days I could see patterns when, after having written a set of CRUD screens for one database table, I was asked to write a similar set of screens for another database table. Unfortunately the means to propagate that pattern in those days was very primitive as it involved making a copy of the first program, then going through the code line by line in order to change all references to table and column names from the first table to the new table. It was quite tedious, but it was quicker than writing a brand new program from scratch. This assured that the structure of the first program, a structure which had hopefully been completely debugged, was duplicated in the new program. Unfortunately if any flaws were found in this structure there were multiple copies of the code which then needed to be modified. Although it was possible to put some common code into libraries, there was no way to easily reuse a program structure except for this copy-paste technique. The common structure I used for building CRUD screens in the COBOL language is shown in Figure 10:\n\nFigure 10 - A typical Family of Forms\n\n\nNote: each of the boxes in the above diagram is a clickable link. Here is an overview of what each function does:\n\nThese six functions use only two screen structures between them:\n\n2nd framework in UNIFACE\n\nIn the early 1990s my employer switched from COBOL to UNIFACE, which was based on the 3-Schema approach:\n\nThe Physical Schema was handled by a built-in database driver which connected the UNIFACE application to a particular DBMS at runtime. This allowed an application to be developed using one DBMS and deployed using another.\n\nThe Conceptual Schema was an internal database known as the Application Model or Repository which contained information on entities (tables), fields, keys (indexes) and relationships, together with referential integrity, for the application database. Each entity and field in the model had properties and a set of triggers, which were containers for Proc code (Uniface's procedural language). Application databases were first defined in the Conceptual Schema and then exported to the DBMS-of-the-day by means of a CREATE TABLE script.\n\nComponents were created by embedding objects from the Application Model into the layout canvas. This would start with rectangle called an entity frame which was linked to a particular entity into which other objects, either fields from that entity or another related entity, could then be painted. At runtime the user would press a button to fire the \"read\" trigger and this would read a record from the database and populate the fields in the screen. This would start at the outermost entity and work its way inwards one entity at a time. This is why in those Transaction Patterns which deal with more than one database table I use terms such as \"outer\" and \"inner\" entity.\n\nThe main advantage of this language was that you could develop an application for one OS and DBMS and then deploy it on a completely different OS and DBMS. Another advantage was that developers never had to write any SQL queries as they were generated automatically at runtime by whatever database driver had been configured. This also had a big disadvantage - it was impossible to write complex queries or to use JOINs.\n\nIt was through working with UNIFACE that I learned about the 3-Tier Architecture. This was implemented in the following manner:\n\nI also learned about XML documents, XSL transformations and component templates.\n\nUNIFACE was initially developed for client/server applications, but the facility to deal with web pages was added on later. I felt that the mechanism for building web pages was far too cumbersome (the use of XSL transformations did not include the ability to create HTML output) so I decided to switch to a more appropriate language. I chose PHP.\n\n3rd framework in PHP\n\nI started to teach myself how to program with PHP in 2002. This was with PHP4 as PHP5 did not exist at that time. As I had already written successful frameworks in both COBOL and UNIFACE I started with the database design, then built the components to maintain each of its tables. I did not use Object Oriented Design (OOD) as I did not agree with its \"is-a\" and \"has-a\" approach for dealing with relations. I also did not like the idea of using an alien technique for designing my software structure as it totally contradicted what I had learned in Jackson Structured Programming and had used successfully for decades. The very idea of being forced to use an Object Relational Mapper filled me with horror.\n\nI chose to use the 3-Tier Architecture as I liked the way it split the program logic into separate layers. I started by building a class in the Business layer for the first table, then a script in the Presentation layer which translated requests from the user into method calls on that class. As I had already proved to myself that PHP could adequately produce XML files and perform XSL transformations I decided to produce all HTML in this way. It was several years later on when a colleague pointed out that what I had actually developed was an implementation of the MVC design pattern. That is why I tell people that I did not not use that pattern by design but by accident.\n\nAfter having written the code to deal with the first database table, which had zero inheritance and zero reusability, I then copied this code to deal with the second database table. I then started to refactor the code by creating an abstract table class which could be inherited by every concrete table class, then moved duplicated code from each of my two concrete classes into the abstract class. This left each concrete class with surprising little code:\n\nBecause I was dealing with database tables, and there are only four basic operations which can be performed on a database table - create read, update and delete - I initially built only four methods into my abstract table class, which were insertRecord(), getData(), updateRecord() and deleteRecord(). All the default code for dealing with these methods was built into the abstract class, but I interrupted this processing flow with a series of blank customisable methods which could be copied into the concrete class and then filled with code so that the default behaviour could be overridden.\n\nI did not like the idea of defining each database column as a separate property in the class so I stuck with a single $fieldarray variable which holds the data in an associative array. I find it much easier to pass the data between different objects in a single variable, either as an argument on the method call or its return value. I can therefore adjust the contents of the array without adjusting the coupling between objects, which provides for loose coupling which is supposed to be better than tight coupling. This means that I can add or remove columns for individual use cases at will, which includes the use of JOIN clauses which add columns from other tables. This associative array can also be turned into a multi-dimensional array in order to hold data for multiple rows by using the row number as the key at the first level.\n\nBecause of the way I had written my page controllers the only difference between them was the name of the table class, so I split each controller into two separate parts - a component script which identifies which table class to use, and a reusable controller script which performs operations on that table. This is a technique which I later learned was called Dependency Injection.\n\nIn my original implementation I used a separate custom-built XSL stylesheet for each screen into which all column names and the HTML controls which they were to use were hard-coded. By refactoring this code I found a way of inserting the column names and their controls into the XML document so that I only needed a very small set of reusable XSL stylesheets which could then deal with any screen in the application. This is done by creating a simple screen structure file which is copied into the XML document and then used by the XSL stylesheet to work out which piece of data goes where. This meant that the form structure shown in Figure 10 could be implemented using a single stylesheet for all LIST forms and a single stylesheet for all child/DETAIL forms.\n\nUniface had a feature called Component Templates which I converted into Transaction Patterns. Several programmers have told me that these patterns do not exist because nobody famous has ever written about them. This just tells me that their ability to recognise patterns or recurring themes is sadly lacking. They will pontificate wildly about design patterns while failing to realise that they do not actually provide reusable code, only designs which then have to be coded by hand. My Transaction Patterns are genuine patterns because it is possible to say \"Take this object, that pattern, and generate a new component\".\n\nIn my original implementation I had all SQL queries generated within the abstract class, but then I moved them to a separate object so that I could easily switch to another DBMS. This was useful when it came to handle the switch from the old mysql extension to the new \"improved\" extension when MySQL version 4.1 was released in 2003. I later added classes to deal with PostgreSQL, Oracle and SQL Server.\n\nIn my original implementation I created all the table class files by hand, but then I created a Data Dictionary to do this for me. Unlike the Application Model in UNIFACE, which was maintained by the developer and then exported to the database by generating a CREATE TABLE script, my version works in the opposite direction. The database structure is created manually, then imported into the dictionary, then exported to create the table class file and a separate structure file. I made these files separate so that the structure file could be regenerated while the class file would be untouched in case it had been customised.\n\nIn my original implementation I created the component scripts and screen structure scripts manually, and also added the component details to the MENU database manually, but I later modified my Data Dictionary to do this job for me using my library of Transaction Patterns.\n\nHow do you read from multiple tables?\n\nThis depends on the structure of the particular screen or form. Each screen can be split into several distinct areas which contain specific pieces of data, some of it provided by the framework and some of it from the application database. The area for application data may be subdivided into different zones for different entities. A LIST1 pattern uses a single application zone, as does an ADD1, ENQUIRE1, UPDATE1, DELETE1 and SEARCH1. The LIST2 and MULTI2 patterns use two zones, an outer/parent and an inner/child, whereas the LIST3 and MULTI3 patterns use three zones.\n\nWhen a single use case requires reading from more than one database table you have to be careful to avoid the infamous N+1 problem which can be stated simply as:\n\nThe \"N+1\" problem involves reading from two tables which exist in a parent-child relationship. In the case of starting with the \"child\" and including a column from the \"parent\", the \"1\" is the query which reads from the \"child\" table and the \"N\" is one query for each parent table for each row in the \"child\" table.\n\nIf the 1st query reads 10 rows from \"child\" you will then need an additional 10 queries to read the \"parent\" of each of those \"child\" rows. If the child has more than 1 parent this will require 10 additional queries for each parent.\n\nIn the case of populating one area with one row from the \"parent\" and populating a second area with multiple rows from the \"child\", some OR mappers will perform one query for the parent and a separate query for each row of the child.\n\nIn order to include data from multiple tables in a single zone, eg. from \"child\" to \"parent\", the preferred approach is to use JOIN clauses in the SQL query. It is possible to get the framework to construct this type of query for you provided that the relevant information has been provided on the parent relationships.\n\nAn alternative but less efficient approach would be to read the different tables one at a time starting with the following code in the _cm_post_getData() method of the first table:\n\n$other = RDCsingleton::getInstance('other_table');\nforeach ($rows AS $rowdata) {\n    $where2 = array2where($rowdata, $other->getPkeyNames());\n    $other_data = $other->getData($where2);\n    if (!empty($other_data)) }\n        $other_data = $other_data[0];\n        $rowdata['field1'] = $other_data['field1'];\n        $rowdata['field2'] = $other_data['field2'];\n    } // if\n} // foreach\n\nIf a screen has more than one application zone then the Controller will require a separate Model class for each zone. In the case of a parent-child relationship this will operate as follows:\n\nHow do you write to multiple tables?\n\nUnless you are using a MULTI4 pattern which allows updates to both the parent and child entities, the Controller will only be able to send the contents of the $_POST array to a single Model entity, as in $object->insertRecord($_POST) or $object->updateRecord($_POST). This means that, by default, it will only be able to update that particular database table. In order to deal with other database tables you will have to put code into the either the _cm_post_insertRecord() or _cm_post_updateRecord() methods, as in the following example:\n\n    $other_data = $other->insertRecord($rowdata);\n    if ($other->errors) {\n        $this->errors = array_merge($this->errors, $other->getErrors());\n    } // if\n\nNote that each class, thanks to its own version of $fieldspec, knows which fields are valid for its database table, so will ignore any data in its $fieldarray or $rowdata array. This also means that when passing the data to the $other object it is not necessary to filter the data. Nor is it necessary to pass the data one field at a time as everything is always passed around in a single array.\n\nHow do you deal with relationships?\n\nRelationships can only be expressed between two tables as a parent-child or one-to-many relationship. This requires one or more columns on the child table to refer to the primary key columns on the parent table. Note that some DBMS engines allow a candidate key to be used instead of the primary key. The columns on the child table are then known as a foreign key. This means that the child table can only ever refer to one row on the parent table, but the parent table can have any number of related rows on the child table.\n\nNote that it is not necessary to define a foreign key constraint before columns can be used as a foreign key. JOIN clauses in a SELECT statement do not reference any of these constraints.\n\nAll relationships are defined in the Data Dictionary and, when exported, will populate both the $parent_relations and $child_relations arrays in the table structure file.\n\nThe $parent_relations array will be examined when constructing SELECT queries in case any JOIN clauses are required.\n\nThe $child_relations array will be examined whenever a delete operation is performed. For each parent table if will look to see if any associated rows exist on each child table, and if any do the action tan will depend on the value for that that relationship type:\n\n\nI have been told on numerous occasions by other programmers that I am a bad boy simply because I don't follow the rules. This is incorrect for two reasons:\n\n  1. I DO follow rules, but they happen to be a different set of rules from those that they follow. There is no such thing as a single set of rules which has been universally accepted by every programmer on the planet as the only set of rules that is allowed to exist, nor will there ever be.\n  2. I DO NOT write software to impress other programmers with how clever I can be. I write it to impress my customers, the people who pay my wages, by producing cost-effective solutions to their problems. I write code in order to produce results, not to follow a bunch of artificial and arbitrary rules. I am a pragmatist, not a dogmatist. Perhaps this is why I don't create software which turns out to be a dog's dinner.\n\nBelow is a list of rules that I have been told that I should follow, and against each one I explain why I don't. You may notice that there is one exception, but my interpretation of that rule is often regarded as the \"wrong\" interpretation. Ask me if I care!\n\nPerceived WisdomActual Wisdom\n1 Use OOD first to design your software structure, and leave the database design to last. NO! Design the database first and create a separate class for each database table. This completely removes the need for OOD.\n2 Use \"is-a\" relationships for inheritance. YES! Every entity is a database table, so every class inherits from an abstract table class.\n\nThe idea that you should create a Customer class which inherits from a Person class simply because a customer \"is-a\" person does not wash in my designs. I build large enterprise applications which deal with Parties who may be either people or organisations and each party may be a customer or a supplier, or even both, or perhaps neither. The attributes Customer and Supplier are defined on the ROLE table, and can be attached to a PARTY via the PARTY_ROLE_LINK table.\n\n3 Use \"has-a\" relationships for object composition. NO! If a property of a class turns out to be more complex than a single value and requires its own table in the database, then it is treated as a separate entity with its own class.\n\nThe idea that you should create a complex class just because some of its properties exist on their own database tables is a clear violation of the KISS principle. I would rather have a simple class for each database table than a complex class for a group of tables.\n\n4 Design complex class hierarchies which can be several layers deep. NO! There are no hierarchies with database tables (except where implied through foreign keys) so there are no equivalent inheritance hierarchies with any table classes.\n\nThe ONLY inheritance is from the abstract table class to each concrete table class.\n\n5 Use lots of design patterns, the more the merrier! NO! Design patterns do not provide reusable code, only reusable designs which still have to be coded by hand, and which can be implemented in an infinite variety of ways. I prefer to use Transaction Patterns which DO actually provide pre-written and reusable code.\n6 Create each Model class by hand. NO! Each class is created by the framework using information which is imported into the Data Dictionary direct from the database schema. Each database table requires two files:\n\n  \u2022 A class file which contains the validation and business rules.\n  \u2022 A structure file which identifies the table's columns and their specifications.\n\nNote that if the table's structure changes it can be re-imported into the Data Dictionary, and the export process will only overwrite the structure file so as not to interfere with any customisations which may exist in the class file.\n\n7 Create each Controller by hand. NO! Each Transaction Pattern has its own controller script which is built into the framework.\n8 Create a single super-Controller for each Model which can handle all the use cases for that Model. NO! Each use case has its own unique component script which shares one of my 40 controller scripts, but each Model can be used by any number of Controllers and Views.\n9 Create each View by hand. NO! Components are already built into the framework to format the application data into either HTML, PDF or CSV. All HTML output is produced from a library of 12 reusable XSL stylesheets.\n10 Create a method in the class for each Use Case. NO! In the real world each use case is actually satisfied by performing one or more operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on one or more database tables, so the User Transaction which implements a use case need do nothing more than specify which operations on which database tables. Methods such as invoice->pay() should therefore be implemented as payment->insertRecord().\n11 Create a separate finder method for each different set of data that you want the class to return, as shown in the Table Data Gateway and Row Data Gateway patterns. NO! The SQL language does not require separate methods, it simply uses a SELECT ... WHERE ... which may be augmented with the addition of LIMIT ... OFFSET ... (or their equivalent). That is why my framework needs nothing more than a single generic getData($where) method which is defined in the abstract class. There are separate methods to set values for LIMIT and OFFSET. The other parts of the SELECT statement can be specified by custom code in each class.\n12 A Controller can only ever access a single Model. NO! An HTML screen can contain one or more areas (or zones) of application data, and each of these areas contains data from a specific database table. In order to use independent CRUD operations on each of these tables the Controller must be able to access each table class independently.\n13 Each column in the table must have its own property in the class. NO! Those who understand how relational databases and the Structured Query Language (SQL) works will know that they deal with rows or sets of data, and the number of columns which can be returned from a SELECT statement can be infinitely variable, especially when JOINS are used to connect to other tables. I find it much easier to use a single property called $fieldarray which can hold any number of columns from any number of rows in a plain PHP array. It is just as easy to reference a column using $this->fieldarray['column'] as it is with $this->column.\n14 Each column in the table must have its own GETTER and SETTER methods. NO! By using a single property called $fieldarray I can hold an infinite number of columns and an infinite number of rows in a single variable, a plain PHP array. All data comes into the Controller in a single variable, the $_POST array, and this array can be passed directly into the Model object, and subsequently the DAO, without having to unpack it. This eliminates the need to have code which specifies column names as the code would have to be different for each table.\n15 Each column must be passed as a separate argument on any method call, as shown in Table Data Gateway. NO! This would create tight coupling as any change in the number of columns in a table would cause a change to the method signature which in turn would affect any object using that signature. It would also prevent the passing in (or out) of any columns which did not actually exist in that table.\n16 Each table object can only deal with a single row. NO! Relational databases operate on data in rows, not individual columns, and the code inside a class can deal with multiple rows as well as multiple columns. Forcing each Model class to deal with a single row, as described in Row Data Gateway, would require extra code in the Controller to instantiate a separate instance for each row, and as a follower of the KISS principle I choose to implement the simplest solution, which happens to be the Table Data Gateway.\n17 If data needs to be transferred from one object to another it must be done using a Data Transfer Object (DTO). NO! A database query can return any number of rows, and these rows can be stored in a plain PHP array. This can be multi-dimensional in that the first level is indexed by row, and each row contains an associative array of name=value pairs. Arrays can be passed around just as easy as objects, and they require less overhead to create and populate. Even Martin Fowler does not think that this is a good idea, as explained in his article LocalDTO.\n18 Model objects should only hold data, while all business logic should be handled by objects in a separate service layer. NO! This is because my definition of a service is completely different. Logic which is specific to a particular entity should always be encapsulated in that entity's class. Only that logic which can be applied to any entity within the application is eligible for placement within a service. In my framework I have Models, Views, Controllers and Data Access Objects. Each Model encapsulates the business rules for a single database table. All the Views, Controllers and Data Access Objects are services because they can execute their logic on any Model.\n19 Use an Object Relational Mapper (ORM). NO! This is supposed to be a cure for the problem called Object-relational impedance mismatch which is caused by having the in-memory structure of an application completely out of sync with the actual database structure. Instead of masking the symptoms of the problem I prefer to eliminate the problem altogether by removing the mismatch. By designing the database first, then ignoring OOD and creating a separate class for each database table the problem simply goes away, which means that I don't need that abomination of a solution.\n20 Objects should not be aware of the database structure. NO! Some part of the code somewhere MUST have knowledge of the database structure otherwise it would be physically impossible to construct the SQL queries which move data in and out of that structure. These queries must contain actual table and column names, and must contain values which conform to each column's data type.\n\nIn my framework, which consists of Models, Views, Controllers and Data Access Objects, the only logical place is within the Models as these are the only components which are allowed to have knowledge of the application. All Views, Controllers and DAOs are application-agnostic sharable services which are built into the framework.\n\nAll data validation, which verifies that the user-supplied value for a column matches that column's specifications, is performed within the Model, so it follows that the Model must have a list of column names and their specifications.\n\nConsidering that the principle objective of OOP is take advantage of Encapsulation, Polymorphism, and Inheritance to increase code reuse and decrease code maintenance then I can clearly demonstrate that I have achieved that objective. My framework's architecture is comprised of Models, Views, Controllers and Data Access Objects (DAO) which have the following characteristics:\n\nUsing my framework I can create a table in the database, generate the table class, then generate and run a family of forms to maintain that database table without having to write a single line of code - no PHP, no HTML no SQL. Unless you can match that level of productivity I suggest you re-examine and refactor your own methodology.\n\nIn 2004 this post identified a study that broke down an application's code into several basic categories - business logic, glue code, user interface code and database code - and highlighted the fact that it is only business logic which has any real value to the company. It compared the productivity of two different teams and found that the team which spends less time writing glue code, user interface code and database code can spend more time writing the \"value\" code and therefore be more productive. My framework follows this idea simply because it maximises the amount of time that developers spend on the important business logic.\n\nNow ask yourself a simple question - if I can break all of those \"rules\" and still produce cost-effective software then do those rules have any actual value? Not only does breaking those rules not have a detrimental effect, I submit that my implementation has a beneficial effect because I can produce effective software quicker and therefore cheaper. Producing cost-effective software is the name of the game, not following a set of artificial and arbitrary rules.\n\nHere endeth the lesson. Don't applaud, just throw money.\n\n\n#1: I have been told that my abstract class must surely be breaking the Single Responsibility Principle for no reason other than it has 9000+ lines of code and 120+ methods. Different people suggest different maximum values. If you read When is a class too big? you will see such values as 7, 10, 20 or more being quoted as the limit. The paper titled A large-scale empirical study of practitioners' use of object-oriented concepts suggests other values.\n\nIf you actually read the Single Responsibility Principle you will see that it advocates the separation of User Interface logic, Business logic and Data Access logic which is precisely what I have done by virtue of the fact that I have implemented a mixture of the 3-Tier Architecture and the Model-View-Controller design pattern. My abstract table class does not contain any UI logic, Controller logic or Data Access logic, so I cannot see any justification for saying that it \"breaks\" SRP.\n\nI was asked to explain what that class does in no more than 20 words and my reply was:\n\nIt is an abstract class that contains methods for any operation that can be performed on any database table. (that's 19 words)\n\nEach concrete class identifies exactly which database table is being accessed as well as containing methods which supplement or replace the default behaviour.\n\nEach concrete class is responsible for the business rules associated with a single database table, so why does that not follow the Single Responsibility Principle?\n\n\nAll the following articles are from",
    "output": " other people who disagree with the object composition approach for representing has-a relationships in an application.\n\nThis is also supported by the following articles:\n\n#1: It appears that the term \"Service Layer\" is a confusing one. According to this blog post the term \"Service Layer\" is a misnomer, and according to Wikipedia the \"Service Layer\" is \"a software layer that consists of a set of functions for processing user transactions\".

    "prompt": "An Introduction to Molecular Biology/Gene Expression\n\nGene expression is the process by which information from a gene is used in the synthesis of a functional gene product. These products are often proteins, but in non-protein coding genes such as ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes or transfer RNA (tRNA) genes, the product is a functional RNA. The process of gene expression is used by all known life - eukaryotes (including multicellular organisms), prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) and viruses - to generate the macromolecular machinery for life. Several steps in the gene expression process may be modulated, including the transcription, RNA splicing, translation, and post-translational modification of a protein. Gene regulation gives the cell control over structure and function, and is the basis for cellular differentiation, morphogenesis and the versatility and adaptability of any organism. Gene regulation may also serve as a substrate for evolutionary change, since control of the timing, location, and amount of gene expression can have a profound effect on the functions (actions) of the gene in a cell or in a multicellular organism. In genetics, gene expression is the most fundamental level at which genotype gives rise to the phenotype. The genetic code stored in DNA in form of nucleotide sequence is \"interpreted\" by gene expression, and the properties of the expression products give rise to the organism's phenotype.[1] A molecule which allows the genetic material to be realized as a protein was first hypothesized by Fran\u00e7ois Jacob and Jacques Monod. RNA synthesis by RNA polymerase was established in vitro by several laboratories by 1965; however, the RNA synthesized by these enzymes had properties that suggested the existence of an additional factor needed to terminate transcription correctly. In 1972, Walter Fiers became the first person to actually prove the existence of the terminating enzyme. Roger D. Kornberg won the 2006 Nobel Prize in Chemistry \"for his studies of the molecular basis of eukaryotic transcription.\n\nFlow of genetic information.\nGenes are expressed by being transcribed into RNA, and this transcript may then be translated into protein.\n\n\nGeneration of RNA from DNA is known as transcription. In other word transcription is the process of creating a complementary RNA copy of a sequence of DNA. During transcription, a DNA sequence is read by RNA polymerase, which produces a complementary, antiparallel RNA strand. As opposed to DNA replication, transcription results in an RNA complement that includes uracil (U) in all instances where thymine (T) would have occurred in a DNA complement.[2] Transcription can be explained easily in 4 or 5 simple steps, each moving like a wave along the DNA.\n\nAs the Hydrogen Bonds Break DNA unwinds.\nThe free nucleotides of the RNA, pair with complementary DNA bases.\nRNA sugar-phosphate backbone forms. (by RNA Polymerase.)\nHydrogen bonds of the untwisted RNA-DNA \"ladder\" break, freeing the new RNA.\nThe RNA is further processed and then moves through the small nuclear pores to the cytoplasm.\n\nTranscription is the first step leading to gene expression. The stretch of DNA transcribed into an RNA molecule is called a transcription unit and encodes at least one gene. If the gene transcribed encodes a protein, the result of transcription is messenger RNA (mRNA), which will then be used to create that protein via the process of translation. Alternatively, the transcribed gene may encode for either ribosomal RNA (rRNA) or transfer RNA (tRNA), other components of the protein-assembly process, or other ribozymes.\n\nA DNA transcription unit encoding for a protein contains not only the sequence that will eventually be directly translated into the protein (the coding sequence) but also regulatory sequences that direct and regulate the synthesis of that protein. The regulatory sequence before (upstream from) the coding sequence is called the 5'UTR (five prime untranslated region) , and the sequence following (downstream from) the coding sequence is called the 3'UTR (three prime untranslated region) . Transcription has some proofreading mechanisms, but they are fewer and less effective than the controls for copying DNA; therefore, transcription has a lower copying fidelity than DNA replication. As in DNA replication, DNA is read from 3' \u2192 5' during transcription. Meanwhile, the complementary RNA is created from the 5' \u2192 3' direction. This means its 5' end is created first in base pairing. Although DNA is arranged as two antiparallel strands in a double helix, only one of the two DNA strands, called the template strand, is used for transcription. This is because RNA is only single-stranded, as opposed to double-stranded DNA. The other DNA strand is called the coding strand, because its sequence is the same as the newly created RNA transcript (except for the substitution of uracil for thymine). The use of only the 3' \u2192 5' strand eliminates the need for the Okazaki fragments seen in DNA replication. Transcription is divided into 5 stages: pre-initiation, initiation, promoter clearance, elongation and termination.\n\nOne gene-one enzyme hypothesisEdit\n\nThe one gene-one enzyme hypothesis is the idea that genes act through the production of enzymes, with each gene responsible for producing a single enzyme that in turn affects a single step in a metabolic pathway. The concept was proposed by George Beadle and Edward Tatum in an influential 1941 paper on genetic mutations in the mold Neurospora crassa,[3] and subsequently was dubbed the \"one gene-one enzyme hypothesis\" by their collaborator Norman Horowitz. It is often considered the first significant result in what came to be called molecular biology. Although it has been extremely influential, the hypothesis was recognized soon after its proposal to be an oversimplification. Even the subsequent reformulation of the \"one gene-one polypeptide\" hypothesis is now considered too simple to describe the relationship between genes and proteins.[4]\n\nWhat is Neurospora? Neurospora crassa is a type of red bread mold of the phylum Ascomycota. The genus name, meaning \"nerve spore\" refers to the characteristic striations on the spores.\n\nN. crassa is used as a model organism because it is easy to grow and has a haploid life cycle that makes genetic analysis simple since recessive traits will show up in the offspring. Analysis of genetic recombination is facilitated by the ordered arrangement of the products of meiosis in Neurospora ascospores. Its entire genome of seven chromosomes has been sequenced. Neurospora was used by Edward Tatum and George Wells Beadle in their experiments for which they won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1958. Beadle and Tatum exposed N. crassa to x-rays, causing mutations. They then observed failures in metabolic pathways caused by errors in specific enzymes. This led them to propose the \"one gene, one enzyme\" hypothesis that specific genes code for specific proteins. Their hypothesis was later elaborated to enzyme pathways by Norman Horowitz, also working on Neurospora.\n\nOne gene-one polypeptideEdit\n\nBy the early 1950s, advances in biochemical genetics\u2014spurred in part by the original hypothesis\u2014made the one gene-one enzyme hypothesis seem very unlikely (at least in its original form). Beginning in 1957, Vernon Ingram and others showed through protein fingerprinting that genetic variations in proteins (such as sickle cell hemoglobin) could be limited to differences in just a single polypeptide chain in a multimeric protein, leading to a \"one gene-one polypeptide\" hypothesis instead. According to geneticist Rowland H. Davis, \"By 1958 \u2013 indeed, even by 1948 \u2013 one gene, one enzyme was no longer a hypothesis to be resolutely defended; it was simply the name of a research program.\" Presently, the one gene-one polypeptide perspective cannot account for the various spliced versions in many eukaryote organisms which use a spliceosome to individually prepare a RNA transcript depending on the various inter- and intra-cellular environmental signals. This splicing was discovered in 1977 by Phillip Sharp and Richard J. Roberts.\n\n\nAn operon is a functioning unit of genomic material containing a cluster of genes under the control of a single regulatory signal or promoter. The genes are transcribed together into an mRNA strand and either translated together in the cytoplasm, or undergo trans-splicing to create monocistronic mRNAs that are translated separately, i.e. several strands of mRNA that each encode a single gene product. The result of this is that the genes contained in the operon are either expressed together or not at all. Several genes must be both co-transcribed and co-regulated to define an operon. Originally operons were thought to exist solely in prokaryotes but since the discovery of the first operons in eukaryotes in the early 1990s, more evidence has arisen to suggest they are more common than previously assumed.\n\nOperons occur primarily in prokaryotes but also in some eukaryotes, including nematodes such as C. elegans. , and Drosophila melanogaster flies. rRNA genes often exist in operons that have been found in a range of eukaryotes including chordates. An operon is made up of several structural genes arranged under a common promoter and regulated by a common operator. It is defined as a set of adjacent structural genes, plus the adjacent regulatory signals that affect transcription of the structural genes. The regulators of a given operon, including repressors, corepressors, and activators, are not necessarily coded for by that operon. The location and condition of the regulators, promoter, operator and structural DNA sequences can determine the effects of common mutations. Operons are related to regulons, stimulons and modulons. Whereas operons contain a set of genes regulated by the same operator, regulons contain a set of genes under regulation by a single regulatory protein, and stimulons contain a set of genes under regulation by a single cell stimulus.[5]\n\nStructure of an operonEdit\n\n\nOperator \u2013 a segment of DNA that a regulator binds to. It is classically defined in the lac operon as a segment between the promoter and the genes of the operon. In the case of a repressor, the repressor protein physically obstructs the RNA polymerase from transcribing the genes.\n\n\nProkaryotic promotersEdit\n\nIn prokaryotes, the promoter consists of two short sequences at -10 and -35 positions upstream from the transcription start site. Sigma factors not only help in enhancing RNAP binding to the promoter but also help RNAP target specific genes to transcribe. The sequence at -10 is called the Pribnow box, or the -10 element, and usually consists of the six nucleotides TATAAT. The Pribnow box is absolutely essential to start transcription in prokaryotes. The other sequence at -35 (the -35 element) usually consists of the seven nucleotides TTGACAT. Its presence allows a very high transcription rate. Both of the above consensus sequences, while conserved on average, are not found intact in most promoters. On average only 3 of the 6 base pairs in each consensus sequence is found in any given promoter. No promoter has been identified to date that has intact consensus sequences at both the -10 and -35; artificial promoters with complete conservation of the -10/-35 hexamers has been found to promote RNA chain initiation at very high efficiencies. Some promoters contain a UP element (consensus sequence 5'-AAAWWTWTTTTNNNAAANNN-3'; W = A or T; N = any base) centered at -50; the presence of the -35 element appears to be unimportant for transcription from the UP element-containing promoters. It should be noted that the above promoter sequences are only recognized by the sigma-70 protein that interacts with the prokaryotic RNA polymerase. Complexes of prokaryotic RNA polymerase with other sigma factors recognize totally different core promoter sequences.\n\n<-- upstream                                                          downstream -->\n           -35       -10       Gene to be transcribed\n\nEukaryotic promotersEdit\n\nEukaryotic promoters are extremely diverse and are difficult to characterize. They typically lie upstream of the gene and can have regulatory elements several kilobases away from the transcriptional start site(enhancers). In eukaryotes, the transcriptional complex can cause the DNA to bend back on itself, which allows for placement of regulatory sequences far from the actual site of transcription. Many eukaryotic promoters, between 10 and 20% of all genes contain a TATA box (sequence TATAAA), which in turn binds a TATA binding protein which assists in the formation of the RNA polymerase transcriptional complex. The TATA box typically lies very close to the transcriptional start site (often within 50 bases).\n\nEukaryotic promoter regulatory sequences typically bind proteins called transcription factors which are involved in the formation of the transcriptional complex. An example is the E-box (sequence CACGTG), which binds transcription factors in the basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family (e.g. BMAL1-Clock, cMyc).\n\n\nAn enhancer is a short region of DNA that can be bound with proteins (namely, the trans-acting factors, much like a set of transcription factors) to enhance transcription levels of genes (hence the name) in a gene cluster. While enhancers are usually cis-acting, an enhancer does not need to be particularly close to the genes it acts on, and need not be located on the same chromosome.\n\nIn eukaryotic cells the structure of the chromatin complex of DNA is folded in a way that functionally mimics the supercoiled state characteristic of prokaryotic DNA, so that although the enhancer DNA is far from the gene in regard to the number of nucleotides, it is geometrically close to the promoter and gene. This allows it to interact with the general transcription factors and RNA polymerase II. An enhancer may be located upstream or downstream of the gene that it regulates.\n\nFurthermore, an enhancer does not need to be located near to the transcription initiation site to affect the transcription of a gene, as some have been found to bind several hundred thousand base pairs upstream or downstream of the start site. Enhancers do not act on the promoter region itself, but are bound by activator proteins. These activator proteins interact with the mediator complex, which recruits polymerase II and the general transcription factors which then begin transcribing the genes. Enhancers can also be found within introns. An enhancer's orientation may even be reversed without affecting its function. Additionally, an enhancer may be excised and inserted elsewhere in the chromosome, and still affect gene transcription. That is the reason that intron polymorphisms are checked though they are not translated.\n\n\nA corepressor is a protein that decreases gene expression by binding to a transcription factor which contains a DNA binding domain. The corepressor is unable to bind DNA by itself. The corepressor can repress transcriptional initiation by recruiting histone deacetylases which catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from lysine residues. This increases the positive charge on histones which strengthens in the interaction between the histones and DNA, making the latter less accessible to transcription.\n\n\nIn molecular biology, a riboswitch is a part of an mRNA molecule that can directly bind a small target molecule, and whose binding of the target affects the gene's activity. Thus, an mRNA that contains a riboswitch is directly involved in regulating its own activity, in response to the concentrations of its target molecule. The discovery that modern organisms use RNA to bind small molecules, and discriminate against closely related analogs, significantly expanded the known natural capabilities of RNA beyond its ability to code for proteins or to bind other RNA or protein macromolecules. The original definition of the term \"riboswitch\" specified that they directly sense small-molecule metabolite concentrations. Although this definition remains in common use, some biologists have used a broader definition that includes other cis-regulatory RNAs. However, this article will discuss only metabolite-binding riboswitches. Most known riboswitches occur in bacteria, but functional riboswitches of one type (the TPP riboswitch) have been discovered in plants and certain fungi. TPP riboswitches have also been predicted in archaea, but have not been experimentally tested.[6]\n\nLac operonEdit\n\nThe lac operon is an operon required for the transport and metabolism of lactose in Escherichia coli and some other enteric bacteria. It consists of three adjacent structural genes, lacZ, lacY and lacA. The lac operon is regulated by several factors including the availability of glucose and of lactose. Gene regulation of the lac operon was the first complex genetic regulatory mechanism to be elucidated and is one of the foremost examples of prokaryotic gene regulation.\n\n\nIn its natural environment, the lac operon allows for the effective digestion of lactose. The cell can use lactose as an energy source by producing the enzyme \u03b2-galactosidase to digest that lactose into glucose and galactose. However, it would be inefficient to produce enzymes when there is no lactose available, or if there is a more readily-available energy source available such as glucose. The lac operon uses a two-part control mechanism to ensure that the cell expends energy producing \u03b2-galactosidase, \u03b2-galactoside permease and thiogalactoside transacetylase (also known as galactoside O-acetyltransferase) only when necessary. It achieves this with the lac repressor, which halts production in the absence of lactose, and the Catabolite activator protein (CAP), which assists in production in the absence of glucose. This dual control mechanism causes the sequential utilization of glucose and lactose in two distinct growth phases, known as diauxie. Similar diauxic growth patterns have been observed in bacterial growth on mixtures of other sugars as well, such as mixtures of glucose and xylose, or of glucose and arabinose, etc. The genetic control mechanisms underlying such diauxic growth patterns are known as xyl operon and ara operon, etc.[7] The lac operon consists of three structural genes, and a promoter, a terminator, regulator, and an operator.\n\nThe three structural genes are: lacZ, lacY, and lacA.\n\nlacZ encodes \u03b2-galactosidase (LacZ), an intracellular enzyme that cleaves the disaccharide lactose into glucose and galactose.\n\nlacY encodes \u03b2-galactoside permease (LacY), a membrane-bound transport protein that pumps lactose into the cell.\n\nlacA encodes \u03b2-galactoside transacetylase (LacA), an enzyme that transfers an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to \u03b2-galactosides.\n\nOnly lacZ and lacY appear to be necessary for lactose catabolism.\n\nlac operon in detail\n\nLac repressor (LacI)Edit\n\nThe lac repressor was first isolated by Walter Gilbert and Benno M\u00fcller-Hill in 1966. They were able to show, in vitro, that the protein bound to DNA containing the lac operon, and released the DNA when IPTG was added. (IPTG is an allolactose analog.) They were also able to isolate the portion of DNA bound by the protein by using the enzyme deoxyribonuclease, which breaks down DNA. After treatment of the repressor-DNA complex, some DNA remained, suggesting that it had been masked by the repressor. This was later confirmed. These experiments were important, as they confirmed the mechanism of the lac operon, earlier proposed by Jacques Monod and Francois Jacob. The structure of the lac repressor protein consists of three distinct regions:\n\na core region (which binds allolactose) a tetramerization region (which joins four monomers in an alpha-helix bundle) a DNA-binding region (in which two LacI proteins bind a single operator site) The lac repressor occurs as a tetramer (four identical subunits bound together). This can be viewed as two dimers, with each dimer being able to bind to a single lac operator. The two subunits each bind to a slightly separated (major groove) region of the operator. The promoter is slightly covered by the lac repressor so RNAP cannot bind to and transcribe the operon. The DNA binding region consists of a helix-turn-helix structural motif. Interactive, rotating 3D views of the repressor structure, some bound to DNA, including morphs of how it bends the DNA double helix, are available at Lac Repressor in Proteopedia. The lac repressor (LacI) operates by binding to the major groove of the operator region of the lac operon. This blocks RNA polymerase from binding, and so prevents transcription of the mRNA coding for the Lac proteins. When lactose is present, allolactose binds to the lac repressor, causing an allosteric change in its shape. In its changed state, the lac repressor is unable to bind to its cognate operator.\n\nThe lac gene and its derivatives are amenable to use as a reporter gene in a number of bacterial-based selection techniques such as two hybrid analysis, in which the successful binding of a transcriptional activator to a specific promoter sequence must be determined. In LB plates containing X-gal, the colour change from white colonies to a shade of blue corresponds to about 20-100 \u03b2-galactosidase units, while tetrazolium lactose and MacConkey lactose media have a range of 100-1000 units, being most sensitive in the high and low parts of this range respectively. Since MacConkey lactose and tetrazolium lactose media both rely on the products of lactose breakdown, they require the presence of both lacZ and lacY genes. The many lac fusion techniques which include only the lacZ gene are thus suited to the X-gal plates or ONPG liquid broths.[8]\n\nTrp operonEdit\n\nTrp operon is an operon - a group of genes that are used, or transcribed, together - that codes for the components for production of tryptophan. The Trp operon is present in many bacteria, but was first characterized in Escherichia coli. It is regulated so that when tryptophan is present in the environment, it is not used. It was an important experimental system for learning about gene regulation, and is commonly used to teach gene regulation.\n\nDiscovered in 1953 by Jacques Monod and colleagues, the trp operon in E. coli was the first repressible operon to be discovered. While the lac operon can be activated by a chemical (allolactose), the tryptophan (Trp) operon is inhibited by a chemical (tryptophan). This operon contains five structural genes: trp E, trp D, trp C, trp B, and trp A, which encodes tryptophan synthetase. It also contains a promoter which binds to RNA polymerase and an operator which blocks transcription when bound to the protein synthesized by the repressor gene (trp R) that binds to the operator. In the lac operon, allolactose binds to the repressor protein, allowing gene transcription, while in the trp operon, tryptophan binds to the repressor protein effectively blocking gene transcription. In both situations, repression is that of RNA polymerase transcribing the genes in the operon. Also unlike the lac operon, the trp operon contains a leader peptide and an attenuator sequence which allows for graded regulation.\n\nIt is an example of negative regulation of gene expression. Within the operon's regulatory sequence, the operator is blocked by the repressor protein in the presence of tryptophan (thereby preventing transcription) and is liberated in tryptophan's absence (thereby allowing transcription). The process of attenuation complements this regulatory action.[9]\n\nArabinose operonEdit\n\nThe L-arabinose operon of the model bacterium Escherichia coli has been a focus for research in molecular biology for over 40 years, and has been investigated extensively at the genetic, biochemical, physiological, and biophysical levels. It is controlled by a dual positive and negative system. There are 3 structural genes: araB, araA, and araD. They encode the metabolic enzymes for breaking down the monosaccharide sugar arabinose into D-xylulose-5-phosphate, which is then metabolised via the pentose phosphate pathway. The initiator region, containing an operator site as well as a promoter, is called araI (the last letter of araI is an uppercase letter \" i \"). Near this site lies the araC gene, which encodes a repressor protein. The AraC protein binds to initiator region araI.\n\nHousekeeping geneEdit\n\nA housekeeping gene is typically a constitutive gene that is required for the maintenance of basic cellular function, and are found in all human cells. Although some housekeeping genes are expressed at relatively constant levels(such as HSP90 and Beta-actin), other housekeeping genes may vary depending on experimental conditions. The origin of the term \"housekeeping gene\" remains obscure. Literature from 1976 used the term to describe specifically tRNA and rRNA. Interpreting gene expression data can be problematic, with most human genes registering 5-10 copies per cell (possibly representing error). Housekeeping genes are expressed in at least 25 copies per cell and sometimes number in the thousands.\n\nRegulation of gene expressionEdit\n\nRegulation of gene expression refers to the control of the amount and timing of appearance of the functional product of a gene. Control of expression is vital to allow a cell to produce the gene products it needs when it needs them; in turn this gives cells the flexibility to adapt to a variable environment, external signals, damage to the cell, etc. Some simple examples of where gene expression is important are:\n\nControl of Insulin expression so it gives a signal for blood glucose regulation\n\nX chromosome inactivation in female mammals to prevent an \"overdose\" of the genes it contains.\n\nCyclin expression levels control progression through the eukaryotic cell cycle\n\nMore generally gene regulation gives the cell control over all structure and function, and is the basis for cellular differentiation, morphogenesis and the versatility and adaptability of any organism. Any step of gene expression may be modulated, from the DNA-RNA transcription step to post-translational modification of a protein. The stability of the final gene product, whether it is RNA or protein, also contributes to the expression level of the gene - an unstable product results in a low expression level. In general gene expression is regulated through changes in the number and type of interactions between molecules that collectively influence transcription of DNA and translation of RNA. Numerous terms are used to describe types of genes depending on how they are regulated, these include: A constitutive gene is a gene that is transcribed continually compared to a facultative gene which is only transcribed when needed. A housekeeping gene is typically a constitutive gene that is transcribed at a relatively constant level. The housekeeping gene's products are typically needed for maintenance of the cell. It is generally assumed that their expression is unaffected by experimental conditions. Examples include actin, GAPDH and ubiquitin. A facultative gene is a gene which is only transcribed when needed compared to a constitutive gene. An inducible gene is a gene whose expression is either responsive to environmental change or dependent on the position in the cell cycle.[10]\n\nTranscriptional regulation Regulation of transcription can be broken down into three main routes of influence; genetic (direct interaction of a control factor with the gene), modulation (interaction of a control factor with the transcription machinery) and epigenetic (non-sequence changes in DNA structure which influence transcription).\n\nThe lambda repressor transcription factor (green) binds as a dimer to major groove of DNA target (red and blue) and disables initiation of transcription. From PDB 1LMB. Direct interaction with DNA is the simplest and the most direct method by which a protein can change transcription levels. Genes often have several protein binding sites around the coding region with the specific function of regulating transcription. There are many classes of regulatory DNA binding sites known as enhancers, insulators, repressors and silencers. The mechanisms for regulating transcription are very varied, from blocking key binding sites on the DNA for RNA polymerase to acting as an activator and promoting transcription by assisting RNA polymerase binding. The activity of transcription factors is further modulated by intracellular signals causing protein post-translational modification including phosphorylated, acetylated, or glycosylated. These changes influence a transcription factor's ability to bind, directly or indirectly, to promoter DNA, to recruit RNA polymerase, or to favor elongation of a newly synthetized RNA molecule. The nuclear membrane in eukaryotes allows further regulation of transcription factors by the duration of their presence in the nucleus which is regulated by reversible changes in their structure and by binding of other proteins. Environmental stimuli or endocrine signals may cause modification of regulatory proteins eliciting cascades of intracellular signals, which result in regulation of gene expression. More recently it has become apparent that there is a huge influence of non-DNA-sequence specific effects on translation. These effects are referred to as epigenetic and involve the higher order structure of DNA, non-sequence specific DNA binding proteins and chemical modification of DNA. In general epigenetic effects alter the accessibility of DNA to proteins and so modulate transcription.\n\nIn eukaryotes, DNA is organized in form of nucleosomes. Note how the DNA (blue and green) is tightly wrapped around the protein core made of histone octamer (ribbon coils), restricting access to the DNA. From PDB 1KX5. DNA methylation is a widespread mechanism for epigenetic influence on gene expression and is seen in bacteria and eukaryotes and has roles in heritable transcription silencing and transcription regulation. In eukaryotes the structure of chromatin, controlled by the histone code, regulates access to DNA with significant impacts on the expression of genes in euchromatin and heterochromatin areas.\n\nPost-transcriptional regulation\n\nIn eukaryotes, where export of RNA is required before translation is possible, nuclear export is thought to provide additional control over gene expression. All transport in and out of the nucleus is via the nuclear pore and transport is controlled by a wide range of importin and exportin proteins. Expression of a gene coding for a protein is only possible if the messenger RNA carrying the code survives long enough to be translated. In a typical cell an RNA molecule is only stable if specifically protected from degradation. RNA degradation has particular importance in regulation of expression in eukaryotic cells where mRNA has to travel significant distances before being translated. In eukaryotes RNA is stabilised by certain post-transcriptional modifications, particularly the 5' cap and poly-adenylated tail. Intentional degradation of mRNA is used not just as a defence mechanism from foreign RNA (normally from viruses) but also as a route of mRNA destabilisation. If an mRNA molecule has a complementary sequence to a small interfering RNA then it is targeted for destruction via the RNA interference pathway.\n\nTranslational regulation\n\nNeomycin is an example of a small molecule which reduces expression of all protein genes inevitably leading to cell death, thus acts as an antibiotic.\n\nDirect regulation of translation is less prevalent than control of transcription or mRNA stability but is occasionally used. Inhibition of protein translation is a major target for toxins and antibiotics in order to kill a cell by overriding its normal gene expression control. Protein synthesis inhibitors include the antibiotic neomycin and the toxin ricin. Protein degradation\n\nOnce protein synthesis is complete the level of expression of that protein can be reduced by protein degradation. There are major protein degradation pathways in all prokaryotes and eukaryotes of which the proteasome is a common component. An unneeded or damaged protein is often labelled for degradation by addition of ubiquitin.\n\nTools for studying gene expressionEdit\n\n\nPlasmids used in genetic engineering are called vectors. Plasmids serve as important tools in genetics and biotechnology labs, where they are commonly used to multiply (make many copies of) or express particular genes. Many plasmids are commercially available for such uses. The gene to be replicated is inserted into copies of a plasmid containing genes that make cells resistant to particular antibiotics and a multiple cloning site (MCS, or polylinker), which is a short region containing several commonly used restriction sites allowing the easy insertion of DNA fragments at this location. Next, the plasmids are inserted into bacteria by a process called transformation. Then, the bacteria are exposed to the particular antibiotics. Only bacteria which take up copies of the plasmid survive, since the plasmid makes them resistant. In particular, the protecting genes are expressed (used to make a protein) and the expressed protein breaks down the antibiotics. In this way the antibiotics act as a filter to select only the modified bacteria. Now these bacteria can be grown in large amounts, harvested and lysed (often using the alkaline lysis method) to isolate the plasmid of interest. Another major use of plasmids is to make large amounts of proteins. In this case, researchers grow bacteria containing a plasmid harboring the gene of interest. Just as the bacteria produces proteins to confer its antibiotic resistance, it can also be induced to produce large amounts of proteins from the inserted gene. This is a cheap and easy way of mass-producing a gene or the protein it then codes for, for example, insulin or even antibiotics. However, a plasmid can only contain inserts of about 1\u201310 kbp. To clone longer lengths of DNA, lambda phage with lysogeny genes deleted, cosmids, bacterial artificial chromosomes or yeast artificial chromosomes could be used.[11]\n\nModern vectors may encompass additional features besides the transgene insert and a backbone: Promoter: Necessary component for all vectors: used to drive transcription of the vector's transgene.\n\nGenetic markers: Genetic markers for viral vectors allow for confirmation that the vector has integrated with the host genomic DNA.\n\nAntibiotic resistance: Vectors with antibiotic-resistance open reading frames allow for survival of cells that have taken up the vector in growth media containing antibiotics through antibiotic selection.\n\nEpitope: Vector contains a sequence for a specific epitope that is incorporated into the expressed protein. Allows for antibody identification of cells expressing the target protein.\n\n\u03b2-galactosidase: Some vectors contain a sequence for \u03b2-galactosidase, an enzyme that digests galactose, within which a multiple cloning site, the region in which a gene may be inserted, is located. An insert successfully ligated into the vector will disrupt the \u03b2-galactosidase gene and disable galactose digestion. Cells containing vector with an insert may be identified using blue/white selection by growing cells in media containing an analogue of galactose (X-gal). Cells expressing \u03b2-galactosidase (therefore doesn't contain an insert) appear as blue colonies. White colonies would be selected as those that may contain an insert. Other proteins which may function similarly as a reporter include green fluorescent protein and luciferase.\n\nTargeting sequence: Expression vectors may include encoding for a targeting sequence in the finished protein that directs the expressed protein to a specific organelle in the cell or specific location such as the periplasmic space of bacteria.\n\nProtein purification tags: Some expression vectors include proteins or peptide sequences that allows for easier purification of the expressed protein. Examples include polyhistidine-tag, glutathione-S-transferase, and maltose binding protein. Some of these tags may also allow for increased solubility of the target protein. The target protein is fused to the protein tag, but a protease cleavage site positioned in the polypeptide linker region between the protein and the tag allows the tag to be removed later. Cosmids Cosmids are predominantly plasmids with a bacterial oriV, an antibiotic selection marker and a cloning site, but they carry one, or more recently two cos sites derived from bacteriophage lambda. Depending on the particular aim of the experiment broad host range cosmids, shuttle cosmids or 'mammalian' cosmids (linked to SV40 oriV and mammalian selection markers) are available. The loading capacity of cosmids varies depending on the size of the vector itself but usually lies around 40\u201345 kb. The cloning procedure involves the generation of two vector arms which are then joined to the foreign DNA. Selection against wildtype cosmid DNA is simply done via size exclusion. Cosmids, however, always form colonies and not plaques. Also the clone density is much lower with around 105 - 106 CFU per \u00b5g of ligated DNA. After the construction of recombinant lambda or cosmid libraries the total DNA is transferred into an appropriate E.coli host via a technique called in vitro packaging. The necessary packaging extracts are derived from E.coli cI857 lysogens (red- gam- Sam and Dam (head assembly) and Eam (tail assembly) respectively). These extracts will recognize and package the recombinant molecules in vitro, generating either mature phage particles (lambda-based vectors) or recombinant plasmids contained in phage shells (cosmids). These differences are reflected in the different infection frequencies seen in favour of lambda-replacement vectors. This compensates for their slightly lower loading capacity. Phage library are also stored and screened easier than cosmid (colonies!) libraries. Target DNA: the genomic DNA to be cloned has to be cut into the appropriate size range of restriction fragments. This is usually done by partial restriction followed by either size fractionation or dephosphorylation (using calf-intestine phosphatase) to avoid chromosome scrambling, i.e. the ligation of physically unlinked fragments. Fosmids Fosmids are similar to cosmids but are based on the bacterial F-plasmid. The cloning vector is limited, as a host (usually E. coli) can only contain one fosmid molecule. Fosmids are 40 kb of random genomic DNA. Fosmid library is prepared from a genome of the target organism and cloned into a fosmid vector. Low copy number offers higher stability than comparable high copy number cosmids. Fosmid system may be useful for constructing stable libraries from complex genomes. Fosmid clones were used to help assess the accuracy of the Public Human Genome Sequence.\n\nBacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) A bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) is a DNA construct, based on a functional fertility plasmid (or F-plasmid), used for transforming and cloning in bacteria, usually E. coli. F-plasmids play a crucial role because they contain partition genes that promote the even distribution of plasmids after bacterial cell division. The bacterial artificial chromosome's usual insert size is 150-350 kbp, but can be greater than 700 kbp. A similar cloning vector called a PAC has also been produced from the bacterial P1-plasmid. BACs are often used to sequence the genome of organisms in genome projects, for example the Human Genome Project. A short piece of the organism's DNA is amplified as an insert in BACs, and then sequenced. Finally, the sequenced parts are rearranged in silico, resulting in the genomic sequence of the organism.\n\nYeast artificial chromosome (YAC) A yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) is a vector used to clone DNA fragments larger than 100 kb and up to 3000 kb. YACs are useful for the physical mapping of complex genomes and for the cloning of large genes. First described in 1983 by Murray and Szostak, a YAC is an artificially constructed chromosome and contains the telomeric, centromeric, and replication origin sequences needed for replication and preservation in yeast cells. A YAC is built using an initial circular plasmid, which is typically broken into two linear molecules using restriction enzymes; DNA ligase is then used to ligate a sequence or gene of interest between the two linear molecules, forming a single large linear piece of DNA.[citation needed] Yeast expression vectors, such as YACs, YIps (yeast integrating plasmids), and YEps (yeast episomal plasmids), have an advantage over bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) in that they can be used to express eukaryotic proteins that require posttranslational modification. However, YACs have been found to be less stable than BACs, producing chimeric effects.\n\nTypes of viral vectors\n\n\nRetroviruses are one of the mainstays of current gene therapy approaches. The recombinant retroviruses such as the Moloney murine leukemia virus have the ability to integrate into the host genome in a stable fashion. They contain a reverse transcriptase that allows integration into the host genome. They have been used in a number of FDA-approved clinical trials such as the SCID-X1 trial. Retroviral vectors can either be replication-competent or replication-defective. Replication-defective vectors are the most common choice in studies because the viruses have had the coding regions for the genes necessary for additional rounds of virion replication and packaging replaced with other genes, or deleted. These virus are capable of infecting their target cells and delivering their viral payload, but then fail to continue the typical lytic pathway that leads to cell lysis and death. Conversely, replication-competent viral vectors contain all necessary genes for virion synthesis, and continue to propagate themselves once infection occurs. Because the viral genome for these vectors is much lengthier, the length of the actual inserted gene of interest is limited compared to the possible length of the insert for replication-defective vectors. Depending on the viral vector, the typical maximum length of an allowable DNA insert in a replication-defective viral vector is usually about 8\u201310 kB. While this limits the introduction of many genomic sequences, most cDNA sequences can still be accommodated. The primary drawback to use of retroviruses such as the Moloney retrovirus involves the requirement for cells to be actively dividing for transduction. As a result, cells such as neurons are very resistant to infection and transduction by retroviruses. There is concern that insertional mutagenesis due to integration into the host genome might lead to cancer or leukemia.\n\n\nLentiviruses are a subclass of Retroviruses. They have recently been adapted as gene delivery vehicles (vectors) thanks to their ability to integrate into the genome of non-dividing cells, which is the unique feature of Lentiviruses as other Retroviruses can infect only dividing cells. The viral genome in the form of RNA is reverse-transcribed when the virus enters the cell to produce DNA, which is then inserted into the genome at a random position by the viral integrase enzyme. The vector, now called a provirus, remains in the genome and is passed on to the progeny of the cell when it divides. The site of integration is unpredictable, which can pose a problem. The provirus can disturb the function of cellular genes and lead to activation of oncogenes promoting the development of cancer, which raises concerns for possible applications of lentiviruses in gene therapy. However, studies have shown that lentivirus vectors have a lower tendency to integrate in places that potentially cause cancer than gamma-retroviral vectors. More specifically, one study found that lentiviral vectors did not cause either an increase in tumor incidence or an earlier onset of tumors in a mouse strain with a much higher incidence of tumors. Moreover, clinical trials that utilized lentiviral vectors to deliver gene therapy for the treatment of HIV experienced no increase in mutagenic or oncologic events. For safety reasons lentiviral vectors never carry the genes required for their replication. To produce a lentivirus, several plasmids are transfected into a so-called packaging cell line, commonly HEK 293. One or more plasmids, generally referred to as packaging plasmids, encode the virion proteins, such as the capsid and the reverse transcriptase. Another plasmid contains the genetic material to be delivered by the vector. It is transcribed to produce the single-stranded RNA viral genome and is marked by the presence of the \u03c8 (psi) sequence. This sequence is used to package the genome into the virion.\n\n\nAs opposed to lentiviruses, adenoviral DNA does not integrate into the genome and is not replicated during cell division. This limits their use in basic research, although adenoviral vectors are occasionally used in in vitro experiments. Their primary applications are in gene therapy and vaccination. Since humans commonly come in contact with adenoviruses, which cause respiratory, gastrointestinal and eye infections, they trigger a rapid immune response with potentially dangerous consequences. To overcome this problem scientists are currently investigating adenoviruses to which humans do not have immunity.\n\nAdeno-associated viruses\n\nAdeno-associated virus (AAV) is a small virus that infects humans and some other primate species. AAV is not currently known to cause disease and consequently the virus causes a very mild immune response. AAV can infect both dividing and non-dividing cells and may incorporate its genome into that of the host cell. These features make AAV a very attractive candidate for creating viral vectors for gene therapy.\n\n\n\nPCR is used to amplify a specific region of a DNA strand (the DNA target). Most PCR methods typically amplify DNA fragments of up to ~10 kilo base pairs (kb), although some techniques allow for amplification of fragments up to 40 kb in size. A basic PCR set up requires several components and reagents.These components include:\n\n\nTwo primers that are complementary to the 3' (three prime) ends of each of the sense and anti-sense strand of the DNA target. Taq polymerase or another DNA polymerase with a temperature optimum at around 70\u00a0\u00b0C. Deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), the building-blocks from which the DNA polymerase synthesizes a new DNA strand. Buffer solution, providing a suitable chemical environment for optimum activity and stability of the DNA polymerase. Divalent cations, magnesium or manganese ions; generally Mg2+ is used, but Mn2+ can be utilized for PCR-mediated DNA mutagenesis, as higher Mn2+ concentration increases the error rate during DNA synthesis Monovalent cation potassium ions. The PCR is commonly carried out in a reaction volume of 10\u2013200 \u03bcl in small reaction tubes (0.2\u20130.5 ml volumes) in a thermal cycler. The thermal cycler heats and cools the reaction tubes to achieve the temperatures required at each step of the reaction (see below). Many modern thermal cyclers make use of the Peltier effect, which permits both heating and cooling of the block holding the PCR tubes simply by reversing the electric current. Thin-walled reaction tubes permit favorable thermal conductivity to allow for rapid thermal equilibration. Most thermal cyclers have heated lids to prevent condensation at the top of the reaction tube. Older thermocyclers lacking a heated lid require a layer of oil on top of the reaction mixture or a ball of wax inside the tube.[12]\n\n\nFigure 1: Schematic drawing of the PCR cycle. (1) Denaturing at 94\u201396\u00a0\u00b0C. (2) Annealing at ~65\u00a0\u00b0C (3) Elongation at 72\u00a0\u00b0C. Four cycles are shown here. The blue lines represent the DNA template to which primers (red arrows) anneal that are extended by the DNA polymerase (light green circles), to give shorter DNA products (green lines), which themselves are used as templates as PCR progresses. Typically, PCR consists of a series of 20-40 repeated temperature changes, called cycles, with each cycle commonly consisting of 2-3 discrete temperature steps, usually three . The cycling is often preceded by a single temperature step (called hold) at a high temperature (>90\u00a0\u00b0C), and followed by one hold at the end for final product extension or brief storage. The temperatures used and the length of time they are applied in each cycle depend on a variety of parameters. These include the enzyme used for DNA synthesis, the concentration of divalent ions and dNTPs in the reaction, and the melting temperature (Tm) of the primers.Initialization step: This step consists of heating the reaction to a temperature of 94\u201396\u00a0\u00b0C (or 98\u00a0\u00b0C if extremely thermostable polymerases are used), which is held for 1\u20139 minutes. It is only required for DNA polymerases that require heat activation by hot-start PCR. Denaturation step: This step is the first regular cycling event and consists of heating the reaction to 94\u201398\u00a0\u00b0C for 20\u201330 seconds. It causes DNA melting of the DNA template by disrupting the hydrogen bonds between complementary bases, yielding single-stranded DNA molecules. Annealing step: The reaction temperature is lowered to 50\u201365\u00a0\u00b0C for 20\u201340 seconds allowing annealing of the primers to the single-stranded DNA template. Typically the annealing temperature is about 3-5 degrees Celsius below the Tm of the primers used. Stable DNA-DNA hydrogen bonds are only formed when the primer sequence very closely matches the template sequence. The polymerase binds to the primer-template hybrid and begins DNA synthesis. Extension/elongation step: The temperature at this step depends on the DNA polymerase used; Taq polymerase has its optimum activity temperature at 75\u201380\u00a0\u00b0C, and commonly a temperature of 72\u00a0\u00b0C is used with this enzyme. At this step the DNA polymerase synthesizes a new DNA strand complementary to the DNA template strand by adding dNTPs that are complementary to the template in 5' to 3' direction, condensing the 5'-phosphate group of the dNTPs with the 3'-hydroxyl group at the end of the nascent (extending) DNA strand. The extension time depends both on the DNA polymerase used and on the length of the DNA fragment to be amplified. As a rule-of-thumb, at its optimum temperature, the DNA polymerase will polymerize a thousand bases per minute. Under optimum conditions, i.e., if there are no limitations due to limiting substrates or reagents, at each extension step, the amount of DNA target is doubled, leading to exponential (geometric) amplification of the specific DNA fragment. Final elongation: This single step is occasionally performed at a temperature of 70\u201374\u00a0\u00b0C for 5\u201315 minutes after the last PCR cycle to ensure that any remaining single-stranded DNA is fully extended.[13] Final hold: This step at 4\u201315\u00a0\u00b0C for an indefinite time may be employed for short-term storage of the reaction.\n\n\nRestriction enzymesEdit\n\nRestriction enzymes recognize a specific sequence of nucleotides and produce a double-stranded cut in the DNA. While recognition sequences vary between 4 and 8 nucleotides, many of them are palindromic, which correspond to nitrogenous base sequences that read the same backwards and forwards.[14] In theory, there are two types of palindromic sequences that can be possible in DNA. The mirror-like palindrome is similar to those found in ordinary text, in which a sequence reads the same forward and backwards on the same DNA strand (i.e., single stranded) as in GTAATG. The inverted repeat palindrome is also a sequence that reads the same forward and backwards, but the forward and backward sequences are found in complementary DNA strands (i.e., double stranded) as in GTATAC (Notice that GTATAC is complementary to CATATG).[15] The inverted repeat is more common and has greater biological importance than the mirror-like.\n\nA palindromic recognition site reads the same on the reverse strand as it does on the forward strand\n\nEcoRI digestion produces \"sticky\" ends,\n\n\nwhereas SmaI restriction enzyme cleavage produces \"blunt\" ends\n\n\nRecognition sequences in DNA differ for each restriction enzyme, producing differences in the length, sequence and strand orientation (5' end or the 3' end) of a sticky-end \"overhang\" of an enzyme restriction.[16]\n\nDifferent restriction enzymes that recognize the same sequence are known as neoschizomers. These often cleave in a different locales of the sequence; however, different enzymes that recognize and cleave in the same location are known as an isoschizomer.\n\nClassification of Restriction Enzymes\n\nRestriction endonucleases are categorized into three or four general groups (Types I, II and III) based on their composition and enzyme cofactor requirements, the nature of their target sequence, and the position of their DNA cleavage site relative to the target sequence. There are four classes of restriction endonucleases: types I, II,III and IV. All types of enzymes recognise specific short DNA sequences and carry out the endonucleolytic cleavage of DNA to give specific double-stranded fragments with terminal 5'-phosphates. They differ in their recognition sequence, subunit composition, cleavage position, and cofactor requirements, as summarised below:\n\nType I enzymes (EC cleave at sites remote from recognition site; require both ATP and S-adenosyl-L-methionine to function; multifunctional protein with both restriction and methylase (EC activities.\n\nType II enzymes (EC cleave within or at short specific distances from recognition site; most require magnesium; single function (restriction) enzymes independent of methylase.\n\nType III enzymes (EC cleave at sites a short distance from recognition site; require ATP (but doesn't hydrolyse it); S-adenosyl-L-methionine stimulates reaction but is not required; exist as part of a complex with a modification methylase (EC Type IV enzymes target methylated DNA.\n\nExamples of restriction enzymes include:[17]\n\nEnzyme Source Recognition Sequence Cut\nEcoRI Escherichia coli\n5'---G     AATTC---3'\n3'---CTTAA     G---5'\nEcoRII Escherichia coli\n5'---     CCWGG---3'\n3'---GGWCC     ---5'\nBamHI Bacillus amyloliquefaciens\n5'---G     GATCC---3'\n3'---CCTAG     G---5'\nHindIII Haemophilus influenzae\n5'---A     AGCTT---3'\n3'---TTCGA     A---5'\nTaqI Thermus aquaticus\n5'---T   CGA---3'\n3'---AGC   T---5'\nNotI Nocardia otitidis\n5'---GC   GGCCGC---3'\n3'---CGCCGG   CG---5'\nHinfI Haemophilus influenzae\n5'---G   ANTC---3'\n3'---CTNA   G---5'\nSau3A Staphylococcus aureus\n5'---     GATC---3'\n3'---CTAG     ---5'\nPovII* Proteus vulgaris\n5'---CAG  CTG---3'\n3'---GTC  GAC---5'\nSmaI* Serratia marcescens\n5'---CCC  GGG---3'\n3'---GGG  CCC---5'\nHaeIII* Haemophilus aegyptius\n5'---GG  CC---3'\n3'---CC  GG---5'\nHgaI[18] Haemophilus gallinarum\n5'---NN  NN---3'\n3'---NN  NN---5'\nAluI* Arthrobacter luteus\n5'---AG  CT---3'\n3'---TC  GA---5'\nEcoRV* Escherichia coli\n5'---GAT  ATC---3'\n3'---CTA  TAG---5'\nEcoP15I Escherichia coli\n5'---CAGCAGN25NN   ---3'\n3'---GTCGTCN25   NN---5'\nKpnI Klebsiella pneumoniae\n5'---GGTAC  C---3'\n3'---C  CATGG---5'\nPstI Providencia stuartii\n5'---CTGCA  G---3'\n3'---G  ACGTC---5'\nSacI Streptomyces achromogenes\n5'---GAGCT  C---3'\n3'---C  TCGAG---5'\nSalI Streptomyces albus\n5'---G  TCGAC---3'\n3'---CAGCT  G---5'\nScaI Streptomyces caespitosus\n5'---AGT  ACT---3'\n3'---TCA  TGA---5'\nSpeI Sphaerotilus natans\n5'---A  CTAGT---3'\n3'---TGATC  A---5'\nSphI Streptomyces phaeochromogenes\n5'---GCATG  C---3'\n3'---C  GTACG---5'\nStuI[19][20] Streptomyces tubercidicus\n5'---AGG  CCT---3'\n3'---TCC  GGA---5'\nXbaI Xanthomonas badrii\n5'---T  CTAGA---3'\n3'---AGATC  T---5'\n\n* = blunt ends\nN = C or G or T or A\nW = A or T\n\nCloning of gene and its expressionEdit\n\nIn molecular biology Cloning refers to the procedure of isolating a defined DNA sequence and obtaining multiple copies of it in vitro. Cloning is frequently employed to amplify DNA fragments containing genes, but it can be used to amplify any DNA sequence such as promoters, non-coding sequences, chemically synthesised oligonucleotides and randomly fragmented DNA. Cloning is used in a wide array of biological experiments and technological applications such as large scale protein production and expression of gene in cell lines like HeLA cells.\n\nIn essence, in order to amplify any DNA sequence in vivo and in vitro, the sequence in question must be linked to primary sequence elements capable of directing the replication and propagation of themselves and the linked sequence in the desired target host. The required sequence elements differ according to host, but invariably include an origin of replication, and a selectable marker. In practice, however, a number of other features are desired and a variety of specialized cloning vectors exist that allow protein expression, tagging, single stranded RNA and DNA production and a host of other manipulations that are useful in downstream applications.\n\nRecombinase-based cloning A novel procedure of cloning or subcloning of any DNA fragment by inserting the special DNA fragment of interest into a special area of target DNA through interchange of the relevant DNA fragments.[21]\n\nThis is a one-step reaction: simple, efficient, facilitating high throughput or automatic cloning and/or subcloning.[22]\n\nRestriction/ligation cloning In the classical restriction and ligation cloning protocols, cloning of any DNA fragment essentially involves four steps: DNA fragmentation with restriction endonucleases, ligation of DNA fragments to a vector, transfection, and screening/selection. Although these steps are invariable among cloning procedures a number of alternative routes can be selected at various points depending on the particular application; these are summarized as a \u2018cloning strategy\u2019.\n\nIsolation of insert Initially, the DNA fragment to be cloned needs to be isolated. Preparation of DNA fragments for cloning can be accomplished in a number of alternative ways. Insert preparation is frequently achieved by means of polymerase chain reaction, but it may also be accomplished by restriction enzyme digestion, DNA sonication and fractionation by agarose gel electrophoresis. Chemically synthesized oligonucleotides can also be used if the target sequence size does not exceed the limit of chemical synthesis. Isolation of insert can be done by using shotgun cloning, c-DNA clones, gene machines (artificial chemical synthesis).\n\n\nFollowing ligation, the ligation product (plasmid) is transformed into bacteria for propagation. The bacteria is then plated on selective agar to select for bacteria that have the plasmid of interest. Individual colonies are picked and tested for the wanted insert. Maxiprep can be done to obtain large quantity of the plasmid containing the inserted gene.\n\nTransfection Following ligation, a portion of the ligation reaction, including vector with insert in the desired orientation is transfected into cells. A number of alternative techniques are available, such as chemical sensitization of cells, electroporation and biolistics. Chemical sensitization of cells is frequently employed since this does not require specialized equipment and provides relatively high transformation efficiencies. Electroporation is used when extremely high transformation efficiencies are required, as in very inefficient cloning strategies. Biolistics are mainly utilized in plant cell transformations, where the cell wall is a major obstacle in DNA uptake by cells. The bacterial transformation is generally observed by blue white screening.\n\nSelection Finally, the transfected cells are cultured. As the aforementioned procedures are of particularly low efficiency, there is a need to identify the cells that contain the desired insert at the appropriate orientation and isolate these from those not successfully transformed. Modern cloning vectors include selectable markers (most frequently antibiotic resistance markers) that allow only cells in which the vector, but not necessarily the insert, has been transfected to grow. Additionally, the cloning vectors may contain colour selection markers which provide blue/white screening (via \u03b1-factor complementation) on X-gal medium. Nevertheless, these selection steps do not absolutely guarantee that the DNA insert is present in the cells. Further investigation of the resulting colonies is required to confirm that cloning was successful. This may be accomplished by means of PCR, restriction fragment analysis and/or DNA sequencing.\n\nGenetic engineering\n\nGenetic engineering is a method of changing the inherited characteristics of an organism in a predetermined way by altering its genetic material. This is often done to enable micro-organisms, such as bacteria or viruses, to synthesize increased yields of compounds, to form entirely new compounds, or to adapt to different environments. Other uses of this technology, which is also called recombinant DNA technology, include gene therapy, which is the supply of a functional gene to a person with a genetic disorder or with other diseases such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or cancer, and the cloning of whole organisms.\n\nGenetic engineering involves the manipulation of deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA. Important tools in this process are restriction endonucleases (so-called restriction enzymes) that are produced by various species of bacteria. Restriction enzymes can recognize a particular sequence of the chain of chemical units, called nucleotide bases, which make up the DNA molecule and cut the DNA at that location. Fragments of DNA generated in this way can be joined using other enzymes called ligases. Restriction enzymes and ligases therefore allow the specific cutting and reassembling of portions of DNA. Also important in the manipulation of DNA are so-called vectors, which are pieces of DNA that can self-replicate (produce copies of themselves) independently of the DNA in the host cell in which they are grown. Examples of vectors include plasmids, viruses, and artificial chromosomes. Vectors permit the generation of multiple copies of a particular piece of DNA, making this a useful method for generating sufficient quantities of material with which to work. The process of engineering a DNA fragment into a vector is called \u201cmolecular cloning\u201d, because multiple copies of an identical molecule of DNA are produced. Another way of producing many identical copies of a particular (often short, for example, 100-3,000 base pairs) DNA fragment is the polymerase chain reaction. This method is rapid and avoids the need for cloning DNA into a vector.\n\nReporter geneEdit\n\nIn molecular biology, a reporter gene is a gene that researchers attach to a regulatory sequence of another gene of interest in cell culture, animals or plants. Certain genes are chosen as reporters because the characteristics they confer on organisms expressing them are easily identified and measured, or because they are selectable markers. Reporter genes are often used as an indication of whether a certain gene has been taken up by or expressed in the cell or organism population.\n\nTo introduce a reporter gene into an organism, scientists place the reporter gene and the gene of interest in the same DNA construct to be inserted into the cell or organism. For bacteria or eukaryotic cells in culture, this is usually in the form of a circular DNA molecule called a plasmid. It is important to use a reporter gene that is not natively expressed in the cell or organism under study, since the expression of the reporter is being used as a marker for successful uptake of the gene of interest. Commonly used reporter genes that induce visually identifiable characteristics usually involve fluorescent and luminescent proteins; examples include the gene that encodes jellyfish green fluorescent protein (GFP), which causes cells that express it to glow green under blue light, the enzyme luciferase, which catalyzes a reaction with luciferin to produce light, and the red fluorescent protein from the gene dsRed. Another common reporter in bacteria is the Lac Z gene, which encodes the protein beta-galactosidase. This enzyme causes bacteria expressing the gene to appear blue when grown on a medium that contains the substrate analog X-gal. An example of a selectable-marker reporter in bacteria is the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene, which confers resistance to the antibiotic chloramphenicol.\n\nReporter genes can also be used to assay for the expression of the gene of interest, which may produce a protein that has little obvious or immediate effect on the cell culture or organism. In these cases the reporter is directly attached to the gene of interest to create a gene fusion. The two genes are under the same promoter elements and are transcribed into a single messenger RNA molecule. The mRNA is then translated into protein. In these cases it is important that both proteins be able to properly fold into their active conformations and interact with their substrates despite being fused. In building the DNA construct, a segment of DNA coding for a flexible polypeptide linker region is usually included so that the reporter and the gene product will only minimally interfere with one another.[23]\n\nGene expression and purification in Practice\n\nProtein expression is crucial in biochemistry as it provides the substrate or enzyme required for further analysis. Before large scale protein expression, a small scale expression checked is usually first applied. BL21 Competent E. coli is a commonly used protein expression competent cells. It contains resistant to certain antibiotics, such as Kanamycin; it can undergo modification to express proteins of interest.\n\nIn an expression check, desired genome is inoculated and expressed overnight in 5ml appropriate media with corresponding antibiotics. After overnight expression, the media containing desired protein is spun down. After supernatant is removed, the pellet is suspended into appropriate lysis buffer and sonicated. After sonication, the sample is spun down. The soluble fraction and insoluble fractions are taken for gel analysis on an SDS page. The approximate size of the desired protein must be known and calculated ahead. If desire band shows up in the SDS page, large scale protein expression can then move on.\n\nAffinity Chromatography\n\nIn a large scale protein expression, three liter cultural flasks are commonly used for inoculation and induction. At the beginning, starter culture of gene of interests needs to be prepared by inoculating already modified protein expression competent cell in 5ml to 25ml of autoclaved media. Media commonly used are LB, TB, etc. Starter culture needs to be incubated in appropriate temperature, such as 37 Celsius, along with well shaking overnight. On the same day, litters of media can be prepared. In the case of LB media, 25 grams of LB is required per liter of deionized water. The culture flasks are taped with aluminum foil and autoclaved. Before inoculation, the LB needs to be remained covered with aluminum foil to stay sterile. On the day of inoculation, the culture media needs to be cool to at least room temperature. Appropriate antibiotics needs to be added into the media with well shaking. Inoculation is done via adding 5-10ml of starter culture into each liter of culture. The media is then placed in a 37 degree shaker. It is important to keep track of the optical density of the inoculate culture. Desire optical density is 0.6. In the case of E. coli, such optical density is obtained after about 3 hours of inoculation. E. coli duplicate its amount every 20 minutes; however, in the presence of antibiotics, such duplication period might take longer. But a 3-hour inoculation period is safe. After 3 hours, the optical density of media should be carefully monitored. If the OD is too low, induction might not be sufficient; while if the OD is too high, we might obtain undesired protein, so an OD of 0.6 is desired. After the OD reaches 0.6, the media needs to be chilled on ice before induction. IPTG is commonly used to induce BL21 competent cell. 1mM of IPTG is sufficient for induction. The induction temperature might be different from inoculation temperature. Induction takes place over night.\n\nOn the second day, media is spun down into pellets. The pellets needs to be lysed via either a French or a microfluidizer depending on the amount of pellet available. French Press is usually good for a 2L culture lysis, while microfluidizer is a better choice for anything go beyond. The actual choice also depends on what is available and how soluble the pellets are in lysis buffer.\n\nAfter the pellets are suspended in lysis buffer, lysozyme, DNase, and RNase are added, and inculated for at least 10 minutes. If inadequate amount of any of these are added, the pellets will appear sticky during lysis and lysis might be incomplete. After lysis, the sample is spun down to obtain the soluble fraction that contain our desired protein. It is crucial to keep the whole lysing process cold as some protein might precipitate in room temperature, or machine got heated up will cause a loss of protein. With the soluble fraction that contain our protein of interest, further purification can be done. Such as salting out, ion exchange, and affinity chromatography. Further purification might involve FPLC.\n\nThe appropriate lysis buffer is crucial in protein expression. Different plasmids express differently in different media. Temperature, and pH are also important factors to take into account.\n\n\n  1. Gene expression\n  2. Transcription (genetics)\n  3.

However, which door conceals which is unknown to you, the player.\n  \u2022 Your aim is to select the door behind which the car is. So, you go and stand in front of a door of your choice.\n  \u2022 At this point, regardless of which door you selected, the game show host chooses and opens one of the remaining two doors. If you chose the door with the car, the host selects one of the two remaining doors at random (with equal probability) and opens that door.

If the sequence of actual events stays the same (you choose a door, Monty opens a door, there's a goat there, choose whether to switch), it'll seem like the situation is the same, but now there's no benefit to switching. $\\endgroup$ \u2013\u00a0Glen O Feb 13 '17 at 7:03\n\nBirthday Problem\n\nFor me this was the first example of how counter intuitive the real world probability problems are due to the inherent underestimation/overestimation involved in mental maps for permutation and combination (which is an inverse multiplication problem in general), which form the basis for probability calculation. The question is:\n\nHow many people should be in a room so that the probability of at least two people sharing the same birthday, is at least as high as the probability of getting heads in a toss of an unbiased coin (i.e., $0.5$).\n\nThis is a good problem for students to hone their skills in estimating the permutations and combinations, the base for computation of a priori probability.\n\nI still feel the number of persons for the answer to be surreal and hard to believe! (The real answer is $23$).\n\nPupils should at this juncture be told about quick and dirty mental maps for permutations and combinations calculations and should be encouraged to inculcate a habit of mental computations, which will help them in forming intuition about probability. It will also serve them well in taking to the other higher level problems such as the Monty Hall problem or conditional probability problems mentioned above, such as:\n\n$0.5\\%$ of the total population out of a population of $10$ million is supposed to be affected by a strange disease. A test has been developed for that disease and it has a truth ratio of $99\\%$ (i.e., its true $99\\%$ of the times). A random person from the population is selected and is found to be tested positive for that disease. What is the real probability of that person suffering from the strange disease. The real answer here is approximately $33\\%$.\n\nHere strange disease can be replaced by any real world problems (such as HIV patients or a successful trading / betting strategy or number of terrorists in a country) and this example can be used to give students a feel, why in such cases (HIV patients or so) there are bound to be many false positives (as no real world tests, I believe for such cases are $99\\%$ true) and how popular opinions are wrong in such cases most of the times.\n\nThis should be the starting point for introducing some of the work of Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky as no probability course in modern times can be complete without giving pupils a sense of how fragile one's intuitions and estimates are in estimating probabilities and uncertainties and how to deal with them. $20\\%$ of the course should be devoted to this aspect and it can be one of the final real world projects of students.\n\n  \u2022 3\n    $\\begingroup$ A quick intuitive explanation of the rough order of the answer to the birthday problem is to notice that for birthdays to be all distinct each pair has to be distinct, and there are $\u0398(n^2)$ pairs for $n$ people. Thus roughly you expect that, if $n \\in \u0398(\\sqrt{k})$ as $k \\to \\infty$, where $k$ is the number of possible birthdays, then there are $\u0398(k)$ pairs each of which has probability $\\frac1k$ of being equal, and so the total probability of distinct birthdays is roughly $(1-\\frac1k)^{\u0398(k)}$ which tends to $\\exp(-c)$ for some positive constant $c$. $\\endgroup$ \u2013\u00a0user21820 Feb 13 '17 at 4:17\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ In fact, this analysis can be made rigorous by using smoothing inequalities.

Namely, Bayes' rule gives us that for $S$ denoting sickness and $T$ denoting a positive test, $P(S \\mid T)=\\frac{P(T \\mid S) P(S)}{P(T \\mid S) P(S) + P(T \\mid S^c) P(S^c)}$.

You just pick $r$ from some fixed continuous distribution $R$ with support $\\mathbb{R}$ (say $N(0,1)$) and compare $r$ against the revealed amount $x$, and answer \"yes\" iff $r > x$. Let the unknown amount be $y$. Then $P(x<y \\mid r<x,y) = P(x>y \\mid r<x,y) = \\frac12$ because $P(x=y) = 0$. And $P(x<y \\mid r>x,y) = P(x>y \\mid r>x,y) = \\frac12$.

This implies that we are justified in considering only the cases I did in my earlier comment. To express the reasoning in more intuitive terms, the game chooses $x,y$ jointly and then swaps them with probability $\\frac12$. So if $r < x,y$ or $r > x,y$, then we answer correctly with probability $\\frac12$.

At each step, you can either choose to leave the game with all the sweets in the pot, or you can continue the game. If you continue, a fair coin is flipped, and if it comes up heads then the sweets in the pot are tripled, but if it comes up tails then the pot is emptied.\n\nIf you can play this game only once, how many sweets would you be willing to pay to play? And how should you play? (Assume that you want to get the most sweets possible.)\n\n$^{[1]}$ Let's not be money-minded here...\n\nThe naive (and incorrect) analysis is to compute that at any step if there are $x$ sweets in the pot and you continue the game then the expected number of sweets in the pot will become $1.5x$. Thus you should not stop. But that is stupid; if you never stop you will never get any sweets! So when to stop?\n\nWorse still, a correct analysis will tell you that no matter how many sweets you pay, you can play in such a way that the expected number of sweets you leave with is more than what you paid! The (silly) conclusion is that you should be willing to pay any number of sweets to play!\n\nIf you think really carefully about it, you will realize that expectation is a very poor indicator of rationality of choice. Instead, everyone will have some risk aversity, more generally a mapping from probability distributions to favourability. One possibility is that a probability distribution is unfavourable iff its median is not positive (representing no net gain). Then clearly this game will never be favourable to anyone with this kind of risk aversity except if you commit to playing for exactly one step. In real life, people will evaluate distributions in a much more complicated way than just checking the median.\n\nThat said, a reasonable rule of thumb is that it is not worth to make a decision whose estimated benefit does not have both positive mean and positive median. Positive mean is necessary for rules of thumb, otherwise you will not benefit in the long run. Positive median will prevent other stupid decisions such as playing the triple-or-nothing game for more than one step or paying more than 1.5 sweets to play it. More risk-averse people will play for zero steps and just take the initial sweet and leave!\n\nThis rule will show (reasonably) not only that it is not worth to pay even 2 sweets to play the triple-or-nothing game only once, but also that it is not worth to offer the game for others to play! Any application of probability to real-life decisions should be able to deal with such situations.\n\n[Further remarks...]\n\nMy claim about the rule of thumb being reasonable is that it should work quite well in real life. Whether it agrees with various mathematical models of human rationality is irrelevant. Secondly, my rule of thumb is merely for determining whether a single option is worth taking or not. To compare between multiple choices of which you must pick one, you would have to extend the rule of thumb. One possible way is to define the value of each choice to be the minimum of the mean and median benefit. Then you of course pick the choice with the maximum value. Thirdly, different people will of course have different ways to evaluate a choice based on its benefit's probability distribution (assuming it can even be translated to some real number). A very risk averse person might take the minimum of the 1st percentile (roughly speaking the minimum benefit you believe you will gain in 99% of the cases) and the mean (average benefit). Someone else may combine the percentiles and mean in a different fashion, such as taking $-\\infty$ as the value if the 5th percentile is below some threshold (such as representing serious hurt), but taking the mean otherwise.\n\n  \u2022 8\n    $\\begingroup$ I argue the problem is not in taking expectations, but the fact that \"how much I value a pile of sweets\" does not have a linear relationship with \"how many sweets are in the pile\". In fact, I assert the rational choice is to maximize the expectation of \"how much I value the pile of sweets\" $\\endgroup$ \u2013\u00a0user14972 Feb 12 '17 at 19:25\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ One strange point not mentioned in your remarks is that there is no strategy which would maximise the expected number of sweets you obtain (not even a mixed-strategy).

And my analogy was supposed to be so that the number of sweets is precisely how much you value the pile. The problem therefore arises independent of you valuation as long as it is unbounded. If you believe that people have bounded valuation functions then yes that's another way to avoid the 'paradox'. But in my experience people do look at percentiles to make important decisions, whether conscious of it or not. $\\endgroup$ \u2013\u00a0user21820 Feb 13 '17 at 3:00\n  \u2022 2\n    $\\begingroup$ @user21820: I'm not sure whether the valuation is bounded, but I'm pretty sure it becomes negative for sufficiently large $n$, at which point I'd keep playing in hopes of losing everything so that I'm not responsible for dealing with a cache of billions sweets.

However, the breathalyzers never fail to detect a truly drunk person. One in a thousand drivers is driving drunk. Suppose the police officers then stop a driver at random, and force the driver to take a breathalyzer test. It indicates that the driver is drunk. We assume you don't know anything else about him or her. How high is the probability he or she really is drunk?\n\nIntuitive first answer might be as high as 0.95, but the correct probability is about 0.02.\n\nSolution : Using Bayes's theorem.\n\nThe goal is to find the probability that the driver is drunk given that the breathalyzer indicated he/she is drunk, which can be represented as $${\\displaystyle p(\\mathrm {drunk} |D)}$$\nwhere \"D\" means that the breathalyzer indicates that the driver is drunk.\n\nBayes's theorem tells us that\n\n$$ {\\displaystyle p(\\mathrm {drunk} |D) = {\\frac {p(D|\\mathrm {drunk} )\\, p(\\mathrm {drunk} )}{p(D)}}} $$\n\nWe were told the following in the first paragraph:\n\n$${\\displaystyle p(\\mathrm {drunk} )=0.001} $$ $${\\displaystyle p(\\mathrm {sober} )=0.999} $$ $${\\displaystyle p(D|\\mathrm {drunk} )=1.00} $$ $${\\displaystyle p(D|\\mathrm {sober} )=0.05} $$\n\nAs you can see from the formula, one needs p(D) for Bayes' theorem, which one can compute from the preceding values using\n$${\\displaystyle p(D)=p(D|\\mathrm {drunk} )\\,p(\\mathrm {drunk} )+p(D|\\mathrm {sober} )\\,p(\\mathrm {sober} )} $$\n\nwhich gives $$ {\\displaystyle p(D)=(1.00\\times 0.001)+(0.05\\times 0.999)=0.05095} $$\n\nPlugging these numbers into Bayes' theorem, one finds that $$ {\\displaystyle p(\\mathrm {drunk} |D)={\\frac {1.00\\times 0.001}{0.05095}}=0.019627 \\approx 0.02 } $$\n\nA more intuitive explanation: on average, for every 1,000 drivers tested, 1 driver is drunk, and it is 100% certain that for that driver there is a true positive test result, so there is 1 true positive test result 999 drivers are not drunk, and among those drivers there are 5% false positive test results, so there are 49.95 false positive test results.\nTherefore, the probability that one of the drivers among the $$1 + 49.95 = 50.95 $$positive test results really is drunk is $$ {\\displaystyle p(\\mathrm {drunk} |D)=1/50.95\\approx 0.019627} $$\n\n  \u2022 4\n    $\\begingroup$ I find this fallacy easier to explain with whole numbers. For every 20,000 drivers tested, 20 are drunk (and will show drunk on a test), and 999 are not drunk but will falsely show as drunk on a breathalyzer test. So the odds that someone showing drunk is actually drunk is 20/1019...unless, of course, he or she was pulled over for swerving and running a red light. ;) $\\endgroup$ \u2013\u00a0Wildcard Feb 14 '17 at 4:13\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ That's actually a more simple and better example.

So you might say \"choose a chord of the larger circle by randomly selecting two points on its circumference\" (implying the two points are chosen uniformly), which gives 1/3 as the only valid answer.

It is described here and on the Wiki well. So I just provide you a way how to make it feel intuitive, to persuade other people that the real probability is computed correctly. It is quite impressive, almost like a magician trick :-)\n\nTake a pack of cards and let someone draw a random card. Tell him that he want to draw the ace of hearts and he should not look on the chosen card. Then show to audience all remaining cards but one which are not the ace of hearts. So then there are two hidden cards: One in your hand and one in his hand. Finally, he may change his first guess. Most people do it and they are most likely correct :-).\n\nTennis-like game\n\nThere are two players, Alice and Bob, playing a tennis-like game. Every time, one player serves the ball and winning probabilities of the ball depends on the player. Player who first reaches say 11 points wins the match. Alice serves the first ball. Then there are three possible schemes:\n\n  1. The winner of the previous ball serves the next.\n  2. The loser of the previous ball serves the next.\n  3. Service is regularly alternating.\n\nOne would expect that scheme 1. helps stronger players and scheme 2 helps weaker players. The paradox is that winning probabilities of the match do not depend on the chosen scheme.\n\nProof sketch: Pregenerate 11 cards with the winner of Alice services (pack A) and 10 cards with the winner of Bob's service (pack B). Then each Alice's (or Bob's) service can be modeled just by drawing a card from the pack A (or B). It can be shown that these 21 cards suffice for any of these 3 presented schemes. And the winner is determined by the cards: there is exactly one player written on at least 11 cards.\n\n\nI have a bag of candies, there are 123 caramel candies and 321 mint candies. Every morning I randomly draw candies from the pack and eat them while they are all the same. When I take a different kind of candy, I return it back. What is the probability that the last eaten candy will be the caramel one?\n\nAnswer: 1/2. (one would expect that it is less than 1/2 since there are less caramel candies)\n\nProof: It suffices to show that every morning the probability that all caramel candies will be eaten is the same as the probability that all mint candies will be eaten. We can imagine that candies are randomly ordered every morning and I am drawing them from left to right. I eat all caramel candies if the order is \"First caramel candies, then mint ones.\". I eat all mint candies if the order is the opposite.\n\nWolf on a circle\n\nThere is a wolf at one vertex of a regular n-gon. There is a sheep at every remaining vertex. Each step, the wolf moves to a randomly chosen adjacent vertex and if there is a sheep, the wolf eat it. The wolf ends when it eats n-2 sheep (so there remains just one sheep).\n\nIntuitively, the sheep at the opposite vertex from the wolf is in the best position. The paradox is that all sheep have the same probability of survival.\n\nProof: Take one sheep S. The wolf will definitely get to an adjacent vertex to S for the first time. This time the sheep on the other adjacent vertex is still not eaten. So for S survival, the wolf have to go around the whole circle without eating S. The probability of going around the whole circle from one vertex adjacent to S to the other without visiting S does not depend on the position of S.\n\nSimpson's Paradox\n\nThere is a research on two medical cures A, B.\n\n200 people tried the cure A, it helped to 110 people (50 men, 60 women) and did not helped to 90 people (60 men, 30 women).\n\n210 people tried the cure B, it helped to 120 people (30 men and 90 women) and did not helped to 90 people (40 men, 50 women).\n\nSo in general, the cure B is better since 120:90 > 110:90.\n\nBut if you are a man, you can consider just men statistics: 50:60 > 30:40, so the cure A is more appropriate.\n\nAnd if you are a woman, you can consider just women statistics: 60:30 > 90:50, so the cure A is again more appropriate.\n\nShocking, isn't it? :-)\n\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ These are all very nice, and I hadn't seen #2 or #3 before, thanks! $\\endgroup$ \u2013\u00a0Especially Lime Feb 16 '17 at 10:21\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ I like the Candy-chain one a lot!

Then it is very unlikely that the other child is born on that date too, so one child is ''specified'' by the date-information. This reduces the question to ''is the other child a boy''? and changes the probability from $\\frac13$ to approximately $\\frac12$.\n\nHowever, I do not recommend to use this example for teaching, as there are many interpretations of this paradox (that partially depend on language nuances of the formulation) and it can add more confusion then clarify something.\n\n  \u2022 2\n    $\\begingroup$ The last couple paragraphs make it perfectly clear, actually, culminating in this sentence: \"The moral of the story is that these probabilities do not just depend on the known information, but on how that information was obtained.\" As an IT professional dealing with such questions as, \"How many servers out of 10000 are likely to have this issue given that these 12 servers have the issue?\" and the fact that data is often gained by sometimes badly written SQL queries (that filter out too much or too little), this is a crucial thing to learn.

Stork Feb 14 '17 at 1:05\n\nThe Shooting Room Paradox\n\nA single person enters a room and two dice are rolled. If the result is double sixes, he is shot. Otherwise he leaves the room and nine new players enter. Again the dice are rolled, and if the result is double sixes, all nine are shot. If not, they leave and 90 new players enter, and so on (the number of players increasing tenfold with each round). The game continues until double sixes are rolled and a group is executed, which is certain to happen eventually (the room is in finitely large, and there's an in finite supply of players).\n\nIf you're selected to enter the room, how worried should you be? Not particularly: Your chance of dying is only 1 in 36. Later your mother learns that you entered the room. How worried should she be? Extremely: About 90 percent of the people who played this game were shot. What does your mother know that you don't? Or vice versa?\n\n\nThis is one of my favorites:\n\n100 prisoners problem\n\nThe director of a prison offers 100 death row prisoners, who are numbered from 1 to 100, a last chance. A room contains a cupboard with 100 drawers. The director randomly puts one prisoner's number in each closed drawer. The prisoners enter the room, one after another. Each prisoner may open and look into 50 drawers in any order. The drawers are closed again afterwards. If, during this search, every prisoner finds his number in one of the drawers, all prisoners are pardoned. If just one prisoner does not find his number, all prisoners die. Before the first prisoner enters the room, the prisoners may discuss strategy\u2014but may not communicate once the first prisoner enters to look in the drawers.\n\nIf every prisoner selects $50$ drawers at random, the probability that a single prisoner finds his number is $50\\%$. Therefore, the probability that all prisoners find their numbers is the product of the single probabilities, which is $1/2^{100} \\approx 0.0000000000000000000000000000008$, a vanishingly small number. The situation appears hopeless.\n\nUp to which value can prisoners improve the probability of being pardoned using a good strategy?\n\n\nSomeone mentioned non-transitive dice, and that reminded me of this one:\n\nSuppose there are two unweighted six-sided dice that you cannot examine, but which you can direct a machine to roll and inform you of the sum. You can do this as often as you like, and the distribution of the sum is exactly what you would expect of a pair of ordinary six-sided dice.\n\nAre they, in fact, a pair of ordinary six-sided dice?\n\nNot necessarily.\n\nThen someone mentioned a secretary problem, which turned out to be about derangements. I had in mind a different secretary's problem, which is also called the sultan's dowry:\n\nYou have $100$ candidates, upon which there exists a total order. The candidates have appointments with you, one at a time, in a random order. From each interview, you can tell exactly how that candidate ranks amongst those you have already examined. At that point, you may either accept or reject the candidate. Any acceptance or rejection is permanent; no candidate, once rejected, may be reconsidered. Your objective is solely to accept the best candidate. What is the strategy for maximizing your probability of doing so, and what is that probability?\n\nAs often happens in probability puzzles, the answer is $1/e$*, which many people find surprisingly high.\n\n*Approximately, with the approximation getting better and better as the number of candidates increases without bound.\n\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ The answer to the secretary problem is only approximately 1/e, with the approximation getting better as the number of candidates goes to infinity. $\\endgroup$ \u2013\u00a0Anders Kaseorg Feb 14 '17 at 2:56\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ @AndersKaseorg: Well, yes.

Wikipedia states it as follows:\n\nYou are given two indistinguishable envelopes, each containing money, one contains twice as much as the other. You may pick one envelope and keep the money it contains. Having chosen an envelope at will, but before inspecting it, you are given the chance to switch envelopes. Should you switch?\n\nThe issue is that there is an amount $X$ of money in the envelope you have. If it's the lesser amount then switching gives you a reward of $2X$ and if you don't then you only get $X/2$. Since both cases are equally likely, it seems that you should switch, even though that is nonsensical since clearly your chance of getting the larger amount can only ever be 50%.\n\nThe Wikipedia article goes into great depth explaining various resolutions of this fallacy. It boils down to the fact that the sum of the two envelopes is the same in both cases, which means that the $X$s considered above aren't actually identical.\n\nA related problem is the necktie paradox.\n\n\nOne that I found surprising as a beginner was that three events (or random variables) can be independent pairwise, but not jointly independent. Or to put it somewhat more strikingly, we can have $C$ independent of $A$ and independent of $B$, yet not independent of $A,B$. Wording it this way shows that it does take care to state independence assumptions carefully, and it also illustrates some non-obvious subtleties in the definition of independence (one of them being that independence of two events does not mean that they don't interact and can't be influenced by a third factor).\n\nOne example of pairwise but non-mutual independence is given on the Wikipedia page.\n\nThe example that I typically use is to take $T$ to be a uniformly random angle in $[0,2\\pi)$ and then consider the events $A = \\{\\sin T > 0\\}$, $B = \\{ \\cos T > 0\\}$ and $C = \\{ \\tan T > 0 \\}$ (effectively, this is just two independent $\\pm 1$ variables and their product, but the trig formulation helps to visualize the events in terms of quadrants).\n\nIt's easy to see that $P(A)=P(B)=P(C) = \\tfrac12$ and that $P(A\\cap B) = P(A\\cap C) = P(B\\cap C) = \\tfrac14$, but clearly $P(A\\cap B\\cap \\overline C) = 0$.\n\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ Could you add some reference to this for further reading? $\\endgroup$ \u2013\u00a0Martin Ender Feb 17 '17 at 9:04\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ @MartinEnder Thanks, I added a wiki link and an explicit example. $\\endgroup$ \u2013\u00a0Erick Wong Feb 17 '17 at 12:26\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ Oh I see now.

Given $n$, find the Lake Wobegon Optimal set, in which that probability is maximum.\n\n\"Lake Wobegon Dice,\" by Jorge Moraleda and David G. Stork, College Mathematics Journal, 43(2):152--159 (2012)\n\n\n  \u2022 We present sets of $n$ non-standard dice\u2014Lake Wobegon dice\u2014having the following paradoxical property: On every (random) roll of a set, each die is more likely to roll greater than the set average than less than the set average; in a specific statistical sense, then, each die is \u201cbetter than the set average.\u201d\n\n    We define the Lake Wobegon Dominance of a die in a set as the probability the die rolls greater than the set average minus the probability the die rolls less than the set average. We further define the Lake Wobegon Dominance of the set to be the dominance of the set\u2019s least dominant die and prove that such paradoxical dominance is bounded above by $(n-2)/n$ regardless of the number of sides $s$ on each die and the maximum number of pips $p$ on each side. A set achieving this bound is called Lake Wobegon Optimal. We give a constructive proof that Lake Wobegon Optimal sets exist for all $n \\ge 3$ if one is free to choose $s$ and $p$. We also show how to construct minimal optimal sets, that is, that set that requires the smallest range in the number of pips on the faces.\n\n    We determine the frequency of such Lake Wobegon sets in the $n = 3$ case through exhaustive computer search and find the unique optimal $n = 3$ set having minimal $s$ and $p$. We investigate symmetry properties of such sets, and present equivalence classes having identical paradoxical dominance. We construct inverse sets, in which on any roll each die is more likely to roll less than the set average than greater than the set average, and thus each die is \u201cworse than the set average.\u201d We show the unique extreme \u201cworst\u201d case, the Lake Wobegon pessimal set.\n\nenter image description here\n\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ +1 I love these, even more than the non-transitive dice. $\\endgroup$ \u2013\u00a0Brian Tung Mar 21 '17 at 15:41\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ @BrianTung: Find me online, send me an email and I can send you a set of physical dice. $\\endgroup$ \u2013\u00a0David G.

You don't have access to the objective true value, but instead to a noisy estimate of it, say a value sampled from a normal distribution with mean the true value and variance $1$.\n\nYou, naturally, pick the choice whose estimate of true value is the highest. When you do so, you discover what the true value really was. Call the difference between the estimate and the true value your post-decision surprise.\n\nNow, the error of your estimate was normally distributed with mean $0$, so you might also guess that your post-decision surprise will have mean $0$ \u2013 sometimes you will be pleasantly surprised, sometimes disappointed. But in fact the post-decision surprise is usually negative, that is to say, you are usually disappointed by your choice!\n\nIn retrospect, this is perhaps not so surprising: certainly if all the true values were the same, you'd simply pick the estimate with the highest inflation due to noise, and more generally, conditional on an estimate being the leader of a pack, it's more likely to be an overestimate than an underestimate.\n\nMore interestingly, if the variances aren't the same for all your estimates, it's no longer correct to just pick the highest estimate to maximise your expected true value. If the highest estimate is also high-variance, it may lead to a lower true value in expectation than a lower estimate with better precision, and so what looks superficially like some kind of risk-aversion (discounting the value of apparently high-variance options) is actually justifiable purely on expected-value grounds.\n\n(Notice also that \"there a bunch of options with some true values, but you only get a noisy estimate of the true value, and you have to decide which to choose\" is a REALLY common situation to be in, so this problem is pretty pervasive in real life optimization scenarios)\n\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ I actually don't think this one is great for an introductory course, because it's too subtle.

I especially like this NYT article as an illustration:\n\n\nFrom a teaching point of view, this is a fun exercise because Monty Hall (the real person) is part of the article, and he plays a role both in validating the math on the \"academic\" version of the problem and in showing the math is meaningless in the real game because he has controls that are not in academic version.

Those individuals who are now approaching the maximum known human lifespan should be thoroughly studied both before and after they die (e.g., the oldest known woman, Jeanne Calment, now 122-years-old and who just celebrated a quiet birthday in her French nursing home last Friday, and the oldest known man, Thomas Mortensen, a 114-year-old American from San Rafael, CA). The exact cause of death should be determined with precision. Data should be obtained for telemere length, percentage of cells which are senescent, percentage of 8-hydroxy-guanine content of mitochondrial DNA, percentage of mitochondrial DNA deletion, oxidative stress, antioxidant levels, rate of apoptosis, and percentage of cells undergoing mitotic division. While the individuals are living they should be interviewed concerning their life style, diet, use of nutritional supplements, use of tobacco, age of siblings and parents at time of death, and many other relevant factors. I propose that a scientific demographic research consortium should be organized to obtain and process these data. Geron Corporation could be enlisted to perform the telomere analysis and determine the percentage of senescent cells. Takayuki Ozawa and his colleagues at the University of Nagoya would be ideal to analyze mitochondrial damage. Prof. Bruce Ames of the University of California at Berkeley could also be involved in the mitochondrial analysis. Pantox Laboratories and/or Genox Corporation could analyze oxidative stress and antioxidant profiles. Immunosciences Lab could determine the rate of apoptosis and the percent of cells undergoing mitotic division. Other individuals or organizations could be involved instead of or in addition to those named. Additional analyses might also be desired.\n\n[NOTE: This topic is almost identical to the first item on Dr. L. Stephen Coles's Top Ten List. It contains some supplementary ideas, and is listed first to emphasize the urgency in obtaining data while the subjects are still alive. It is suggested that the proposed scientific demographic consortium should be organized immediately.]\n\n2. What is the mechanism by which telomere shortening causes replicative senescence?\n\nThe known sequence of genes in the cell senescent pathway includes ATM, p53, Ceramide, CAPP and/or p21 (= WAF1/CIP1), and Rb (Elledge, pp. 1666, 1669; Savitsky, et al, p. 1752; Shay, pp. 381-382; Wright and Shay, p. 194; Shay, et al, 1991, pp. 5-6; Hannun, pp.1855-1856; El-Deiry, et al, pp. 1169-1174; Canman, et al, pp.280-283; Sherr, p. 1675; Enoch and Norbury, pp. 426-430; Lavin, et al, pp. 382-383). Ceramide and CAPP lie between p53 and Rb in the processing pathway; likewise p21 also lies between p53 and Rb, but the relationship between p21 and Ceramide or CAPP is unclear. The complete genetic pathway from an unknown gene or genes upstream from the ATM and p53 genes needs to be defined. How does telomere shortening activate this unknown gene(s)? Two possibilities are (1) \"shortened telomeres are interpreted by the cells as DNA damage, signaling induction of p53 and cell cycle arrest,\" and (2) the invoking of \"changes in expression of regulatory genes located in subtelomeric heterochromatin upon aging\" (Shay, p. 382). Senescent cells are metabolically active, have some genes which respond to mitogens and some which don't, resemble terminally differentiated cells, and are resistant to apoptosis (Campisi, 1996, p. 498). How and why are senescent cells different from terminally-differentiated-or postmitotic-cells and quiescent cells?\n\n3. Does the accumulation of senescent cells in an organism contribute to the aging of that organism?\n\nWe do not age or die because our cells can no longer divide (Hayflick, p. 132; Fossel, pp. 52-53). Even cells from very old humans can still divide. Although senescent cells are still metabolically active (Campisi, 1996, p. 498), their biochemical functions have altered, and they can no longer perform as younger cells do (Hayflick, p. 132; Campisi, 1996, p. 499). This altered function \"may have a substantial impact in aged tissue. . . . Moreover, relatively few senescent cells would be needed for some of these effects\" (Campisi, 1996, p. 499).\n\nThe accumulation of certain types of senescent cells can have fatal results. Some centenarians have been shown to have senescent CD8 cells (Effros, et al, p. F20), which could be part of the basis for immunological senescence, leaving the elderly vulnerable to disease and infection. Loss of replicative capacity and alteration in gene expression of senescent arterial cells have been implicated in age-related cardiovascular disease (Chang and Harley, pp. 11190-11193). These are two examples in which the effects of aging are caused by the fact that senescent cells can no longer replicate. What other symptoms of aging are the result of accumulation of senescent cells?\n\n4. Does shortening of telomeres cause changed expression of some genes, or is this caused by other concurrent factors? What is the mechanism by which change of gene expression occurs in senescent cells?\n\nA number of researchers have observed the change in gene expression of senescent cells as compared to younger ones (Hayflick, pp.132-133, 135; Shay, et al, 1992, pp. 486-489; Campisi, 1996, p. 499; Dimri, et al, p. 9363; Linskens, et al, pp. 3244, 3249-3251; Kipling, p. 137; Fossel, pp. 73-82). Some of the theories to explain this effect include:\n\nd. Possibly some changes in gene expression of senescent cells are due to mutations caused by free radicals. Nuclear DNA would seem to be more vulnerable to free radical attack during mitosis when it is not protected by the nuclear envelope. (However, bundling of the chromatin fiber into the karyotypic chromosome form at this time might afford some protection.) If this hypothesis is valid, one might expect some correlation between the number of cell divisions and the number of mutations caused by free radicals. This view is entirely speculative on my part. Work by Linskens, et al, showed senescent changes in cells which began in vitro as neonatal cells (Linskens, et al, pp.3244-3251). One would think that these cells would have had more limited exposure to free radicals in vitro than comparable cells in vivo over a longer time period. The consistent repetition of specific phenotypic characteristics (Shay, et al, 1992, p. 489) also indicates that at least some senescent changes in gene expression are probably not due to mutations, which could be expected to be more random in nature.\n\nChange in gene expression may be due to multiple factors, including shortening telomeres and free radical induced mutations. Those changes which are affected by telomere length may be caused by a combination of heterochromatin, telomere binding proteins, and modification of the physical configuration of telomeric chromatin, as described above. Kipling describes telomere function and structure as follows:\n\nProtecting a telomere from fusion and recombination may not be a direct result of the DNA sequence but rather a result of the action of telomere binding proteins. In S. cerevisiae the RAP1 protein, in concert with a range of other factors, is speculated to form a heterochromatin-like domain at the telomere, making the double-stranded terminus inaccessible to nucleases or recombination enzymes as well as ensuring that natural chromosome ends do not activate cell cycle checkpoints which monitor DNA damage (Kipling, p. 97).\n\nAlteration of gene expression begins to occur prior to cellular senescence. Hayflick expressed the opinion that the same process which causes aging affects both dividing and nondividing cells (Hayflick, pp. 133-134). If he is correct, then cellular aging as it is related to shortening telomeres is a secondary effect. However, b-galactosidase has been found to occur in replicatively senescent cells, but not in quiescent, terminally differentiated, or immortal cells (Dimri, et al, pp. 9364-9367; Campisi, 1996, p. 499). This is only one example of an effect in senescent cells which is different from other cells. Other phenotypical changes in senescent cells include: overexpression of collagenase, interleukin-1, and cytokines; underexpression of collagenase inhibitors and interleukin-6 (Campisi, 1996, p. 499); repression of c-fos (Campisi, 1992, pp. 398-400); and modified expression of terminin (Wang, p. 422). Cristofalo et al compare differential gene expression in young and senescent cells (Cristofalo, et al, pp. 429-432). Linskens et al list several genes which are differentially expressed in senescent cells (Linskens, et al, p. 3248).\n\nThe complete molecular structure of human telomeres with binding proteins needs to be characterized as it has been in Oxytricha nova (Schultz; see also Kipling, pp. 97-107). The physical conformation of both single-strand and double-strand telomere binding proteins with the telomere should be defined in detail. A mammalian double-strand telomere binding protein, TRF1, has been identified (van Steensel and de Lange, pp. 740-743; Zhong, et al, pp. 4834-4843), but not a single-strand binding protein.\n\n5. How can telomeres be extended in all somatic cells of laboratory animals and maintained at a constant length? Would maintaining telomere length in somatic cells of laboratory animals extend their maximum life span?\n\nHarley et al stated that \". . . if manipulation of cellular life span were technically possible through regulation of telomerase, it might be possible to decrease morbidity or increase life span of the organism\" (Harley, et al, p. 381). Would laboratory animals in which telomere length is maintained have a higher incidence of cancer? The possibility of uncontrolled proliferation of cells which never reach replicative senescence due to maintaining telomeres at a more or less constant length should be considered. Could oncogenes promote cell replication which would result in cancer because telomeres would never shorten to the point at which senescence would occur? Experimental inducement of cellular immortality (cancer) is difficult to accomplish in human cells by other than specific viral vectors (Shay, et al, 1991, pp. 2, 6). The in vitro transfection of human cells with T-antigen of the SV40 virus enables replication to continue past the normal point of senescence until cell crisis occurs, but immortalization of these cells is extremely rare (Shay, et al, 1991, p. 3). However, rodent cells are more easily immortalized with the SV40 T-antigen (Shay, et al, 1991, pp. 2-3, 6). Determination of the cause of this difference between human and rodent cells could elucidate the mechanism by which some cells undergoing cellular crisis are transformed into immortal cancer cells. The relative ease with which rodent cells are immortalized suggests that experiments in life extension by maintaining telomere length might better employ a different laboratory animal than rodents.\n\nA potential problem in experimentally lengthening telomeres is that such modification may have an adverse effect on the organism. Tetrahymena in which telomeres were lengthened appeared sick; however, this effect was probably due to the fact that the nucleotide sequence was also changed (Kipling, pp. 83, 130; Blackburn, p. 571). Cells of Schizosaccharomyces pombe thrived for many generations after significant lengthening of their telomeres (Cooper, et al, pp. 745-746).\n\nThe question has been raised as to whether Dolly, the Scottish sheep clone, began life with shorter than normal telomeres because the source of her DNA was from an adult cell which had already undergone many divisions. If her telomeres are short, she could be expected to exhibit signs of premature aging at some time and to die at an earlier age than normal. If this is found to be true, cloning could provide a valuable tool for analysis of senescent gene expression. However, Fossel has postulated that she probably could not have survived until birth unless her telomeres had been elongated by telomerase early in her development (personal communication). In humans about half the length of the telomere is expended during fetal development; development in sheep is presumably similar. If Fossel's interpretation is correct, experimental lengthening of telomeres in laboratory animals would seem to have a better chance of success. Analysis of telomeres related to the cloning of Dolly should include ova and udder cells of the DNA donor sheep, ova from Dolly, and cells from other lambs her age. The ova would provide data on the maximum length of telomeres in their respective sources.\n\nProtection of chromosome ends and the shortening of telomeres during replication are not the only significant functions of telomeres. In recent research telomeres or associated proteins were shown to play a role in the coherence of sister chromatids during mitosis (Kirk, et al, pp. 1478-1481). Telomere-telomere association in the organization of nuclear chromatin has also been discussed by Kipling (pp. 17, 19-20, 25-26, 99-100).\n\n6. What is the mechanism by which telomerase begins to be expressed in some cells which have reached the crisis stage of division? What mutation has occurred? What causes the mutation? (See comments above on human versus rodent cell immortalization.)\n\n7. Is there a correlation between telomere shortening, percentage of mitochondrial DNA guanine converted to 8-hydroxy-guanine, and mitochondrial DNA deletion with aging? If so, what are the causative factors which would synchronize these processes?\n\nThe correlation between telomere shortening in human replicative cells and age has been demonstrated (Allsopp, et al, 10115, 10116; Chang and Harley, pp. 11191-11192), although with some scatter in the data. A closer correlation exists between replicative capacity and telomere length (Allsopp, et al, 10115, 10116). A similar correlation between the 8-hydroxy-guanine content of mitochondrial DNA and mitochondrial DNA deletion in human cardiac postmitotic muscle cells with age has been identified (Hayakawa, et al, 1992, pp. 979-985; Katsumata, et al, p. 106; Ozawa, pp. 177-178, 183, 188; Hayakawa, et al, 1996, pp. 369-376). Why do these two apparently unrelated processes, one operating on replicative cells and the other on nonreplicating cells, both display a correlation with age? If mitochondrial damage to both types of cells is comparable, then perhaps the elements which could connect the free radical, mitochondrial, and telomere theories of aging might include the following:\n\na. Reactive oxygen species (free radicals) are generated in the mitochondria as part of the normal metabolic process.\nb. Reactive oxygen species cause somatic mutations and deletions of mitochondrial DNA.\nc. Mitochondrial DNA damage causes an increase in the production of reactive oxygen species.\nd. Excess reactive oxygen species contribute to cellular apoptosis and necrosis.\ne. Cells suffering the greatest damage from free radicals are selected for apoptosis.\nf. Apoptosis and necrosis of cells result in replication of other cells to replace them.\ng. Replication of cells results in shorter telomeres.\nh. Both telomere shortening and mitochondrial damage may participate in the aging process.\n\nThat reactive oxygen species damage mitochondrial DNA should come as no surprise considering their potency and proximity to mitochondrial DNA. Oxidative damage to mitochondrial DNA has been estimated to be at least ten times as high as to nuclear DNA (Ames, Shigenaga, and Hagen, p. 165; Linnane, et al, p. 643; Ozawa, p. 184). \"The higher levels of oxidative damage and mutation in mtDNA have been ascribed to 3 factors: (a) location of the DNA near the inner mitochondrial membrane sites where oxidants are formed, (b) lack of protective histones, and (c) lack of DNA repair activity\" (Ames, Shigenaga, and Hagen, pp. 165-166). However, some evidence of a mitochondrial DNA repair mechanism has been reported (Driggers, et al, pp. 22042-22045; Ames and Shigenaga, p. 88). Ozawa describes the \"vicious cycle\" of reactive oxygen species causing mitochondrial DNA damage, which then results in an increase in production of reactive oxygen species (Ozawa, pp. 185-186).\n\nApoptosis has been shown to occur as a result of exogenous oxygen stress (Yoneda, et al, pp. 723-729). Endogenous mitochondrial oxidants are also believed to play a role in apoptosis (Slater, et al, pp. 60-61; Korsmeyer, et al, 64-65). Ozawa states that \". . . the electron-transport chain could be regarded as the efficient plant of hydroxyl radical production, essential for the programmed cell death, apoptosis . . .\" (Ozawa, p. 182; see also p. 188). Experiments in which human leukemia HL-60 cells were treated in vitro with peroxynitrite stimulated the formation of reactive oxygen species which then caused apoptosis (Lin, et al, pp. 115-119). Treatment of human fibroblast cells with H2O2 caused \". . . morphological changes associated with apoptotic cell death . . .\" (Yakes and Van Houten, p.518). The Bcl-2 and Bax proteins are involved in control of apoptosis, with Bcl-2 being commonly located in the outer mitochondrial membrane (Korsmeyer, et al, pp. 63-66) near the primary source of reactive oxygen species. The processive pathway by which endogenous free radicals induce apoptosis has not been defined. One possible course would be to affect the p53 gene which is sensitive to oxidation and which is involved in apoptosis. However, in an in vitro study done by Russo et al diethylmaleate (DEM) was employed to deplete intracellular reduced glutathione and hence cause an increase in endogenous free radicals. The effect was to deactivate p53 and to induce expression of p21 (WAF1/CIP1), which resulted in cell cycle arrest. A number of cell lines were employed in their experiments, none of which were normal wild type. Use of an unmodified cell line with an extended range of concentrations of DEM could provide a valuable extension of their approach. Perhaps a lower dose of DEM would not have deactivated p53, which then might have induced apoptosis. Tumour necrosis factor- a (TNF-a) is an extracellular inducer of apoptosis (Hannun, p. 1856). Richter et al state that \"TNF-a stimulates mitochondrial ROS [reactive oxygen species] production in mouse fibrosarcoid cells and causes their apoptotic death. Apoptosis is at least in part related to ROS-induced mitochondrial Ca2+ cycling . . .\" (Richter, et al, p. 69). \"These findings pose the question whether one common (final?) pathway of apoptosis is oxidative stress coupled to mitochondrial Ca2+ cycling\" (Richter, et al, p. 72).\n\nSimple logic would suggest that the greater the damage to a cell, the more likely that it will be the victim of apoptosis. As free radicals damage mitochondrial DNA, the ability of the mitochondria to perform their metabolic function is reduced, and they then generate even more free radicals. Those cells producing the most free radicals would be the most likely to be destroyed by apoptosis, whereas those suffering the least damage would be more likely to survive. This natural selection process would be a significant factor in limiting the accumulation of mitochondrial DNA damage in replicative cells. Once a cell reaches senescence the selective process ends, and mitochondrial DNA damage would be expected to accumulate because senescent cells are resistant to apoptosis (Campisi, 1996, p. 498). Assuming postmitotic cells are also resistant to apoptosis, the process of selecting for less damaged cells cannot function, and mitochondrial DNA damage accumulates. \"Especially in post-mitotic cells, the mitochondrial genome mutations accumulate during life by escaping the excision repair and cellular selection by mitosis\" (Ozawa, p.178).\n\nMitogenic factors include oxidants produced by phagocytes and neutrophils in the inflammatory response to exogenous irritants (Ames and Shigenaga, pp. 88-89). Perhaps mitochondrial oxidants produced during cellular respiration and which are involved in apoptosis are also mitogenic. If so, is the mitogenic effect of free radicals direct on the cell in which they are generated, or is it indirect by causing apoptosis of the cell in which they reside? How do free radicals cause apoptosis? Does the apoptosis then have a mitogenic effect on neighboring cells? What is the signaling pathway by which other cells are induced to divide? Mordechai et al found that the rate of apoptosis increased with the age of the individuals tested and that a higher percentage of peripheral blood mononuclear cells were in the G2 or M phase of the cell cycle in older individuals than in younger (Mordechai, et al, p. 28), indicating that these cells were in the process of dividing. Division of cells to replace dead ones is a likely occurrence. In recent research non-mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (primarily superoxide) was shown to be a mediator of mitogenesis initiated through the Ras gene (Irani, et al, pp. 1649-1652). The study did not address the issue of whether reactive oxygen species could induce mitogenesis independent of the Ras pathway. Mild oxidative stress has been reported to increase \"rates of telomere shortening and accelerated entry into senescence\" (Shay, p. 381). Shorter telomeres would obviously result from cell division due to the end replication problem. Of course, other mitogenic factors also affect the number of cellular divisions which occur. The proportion of mitogenic effect which is caused by free radicals (if any) as compared to other mitogenic factors significantly affects the strength of the linkage between the mitochondrial and telomere theories of aging postulated here.\n\nFor discussions of the telomere theory of aging refer to Shay; Harley, et al; Campisi, 1996; and to Fossel in the bibliography. The mitochondrial theory of aging is presented by Linnane, et al; Ozawa; Ames and Shigenaga; Ames, Shigenaga, and Hagen; and Wallace, et al, pp. 141-143, 149.\n\nThe course of events listed above might help to explain the parallel results between the ostensibly independent processes of mitochondrial DNA damage and telomere shortening. The assumption in this hypothesis is that replicative cells undergo similar mitochondrial DNA damage to that in postmitotic heart muscle cells, but this is not known. A lower rate of accumulation of mitochondrial DNA damage would be expected in replicative cells due to the selective removal of damaged cells by apoptosis and the preferential retention of cells in better condition. However, possibly a lower rate of mitochondrial damage in some replicative cells could be due simply to a lower metabolic rate than that in heart and brain cells. It would seem unlikely that the two significant aging factors of mitochondrial damage and telomere shortening could occur simultaneously without interacting in some manner. Campisi has suggested that \". . . renewable and postmitotic tissues may age by different (albeit interacting) mechanisms\" (Campisi, 1996, p. 499, emphasis added).\n\nHowever, there may be no direct correlation between mitochondrial aging and telomere aging other than evolution. There would be no advantage for a species to have telomeres which could last for 500 years if its mitochondria could only survive for 129 years, or vice versa. The two processes might have no causal relationship other than evolutionary selection. The 129 year figure is taken from Ozawa (p. 185; see also: Hayakawa, et al, 1992, pp. 980, 982-983; Hayakawa, et al, 1996, pp. 370-371) who states that the ratio of mtDNA with a 7.4 kbp deletion to the total mtDNA in heart muscle tissue increases exponentially with age up to 7 percent at age 97, the last age for which data are available. The formula is:\n\nlog (deleted mtDNA percentage) = 0.0407 (age) - 3.23\n\nwith a correlation coefficient of r = 0.87 at p<0.01. Linear extrapolation of this log function to 100 percent deletion occurs at age 129. This age would exceed the maximum life expectancy for humans regarding their myocardial bioenergetic function (Ozawa, p. 185) because an individual would expire before deletion reached 100 percent. More data are needed for the 95+ year age group to improve the reliability of the extrapolated maximum age. Additional data also would be expected to exhibit more variation than is shown in the work of Ozawa, Hayakawa, and their colleagues.\n\nThe degree of mitochondrial damage is probably a direct function of the quantity of reactive oxygen species produced, which in turn can probably be directly correlated with the quantity of energy (ATP) produced and consumed by the cell as adjusted for the effects of antioxidants. However, as mitochondrial DNA damage occurs the efficiency of the mitochondria degenerates, and more free radicals are generated in proportion to the ATP produced. This is what Ozawa calls the \"vicious cycle\" (Ozawa, pp. 185-186). If there is a correlation between mitochondrial damage and telomere loss, it would most likely be found in replicative cells which have a high energy consumption. Consideration should be given to identifying this type of cell and analyzing it for both mitochondrial damage and telomere shortening. Possible candidate cells could include glial cells in the brain, lung fibroblasts, and intestinal cells. Because mitochondrial studies have been performed on brain neurons (Ikebe, et al, pp. 1044-1048; Wallace, et al, p. 149), investigation of associated glial cells could prove informative.\n\nFossel properly emphasizes the role of telomeres in aging, but states that \"The genes in your mitochondria . . . can be ignored for our purposes\" (Fossel, p. 15). He gives due consideration to the effects of free radicals (pp. 26-31, 36-40, 46-47), but suggests that, subject to the inaccuracy of the estimates, \"we could expect to die of mitochondrial loss in about 7,000 years\" (p. 215). \"Perhaps the damage that accrues depends upon changes in gene expression in the cell's nucleus and hence upon telomeres that alter that gene expression in aging. In short, lengthening the telomere might prevent mitochondrial damage\" (Fossel, p. 215). Support for this view can be found in the fact that of the approximately 700 proteins contained in mitochondria, less than 10 percent are transcribed by mitochondrial genes, the majority being the products of nuclear genes (Kleinsmith and Kish, pp. 512, 658). Mitochondria are thought to have originated from eubacteria which had developed a symbiotic relationship with early eukaryotes at least a billion years ago (Kleinsmith and Kish, p. 665). Since then evolution has resulted in nuclear genes dominating most mitochondrial functions. Whether any of these nuclear genes changes expression with shortening telomeres would require a more extensive literature search than has been conducted here, and would more likely require original research. Possibly there is a feedback mechanism of senescent gene expression affecting mitochondrial respiration in replicative cells, but a more direct connection would seem to be that telomeres become shorter as a secondary effect of the action of reactive oxygen species primarily in mitochondria. The flow of cause and effect is most likely from mitochondria to telomeres, rather than the other way around. That changes in gene expression of senescent replicative cells could produce proteins which would directly cause mitochondrial DNA damage in other nonreplicative cells is highly improbable. The mitochondrial DNA damage in cardiac muscle cells which has been correlated with age obviously could not have been caused by telomere induced senescence within the same cells because the cells are postmitotic and have not divided a sufficient number of times to become senescent.\n\nFossel has expressed the view that the exponential increase in mitochondrial DNA damage in the later years of human life is probably triggered by senescent gene expression having a negative effect on mitochondrial function in proliferative cells (personal communication). He also makes a reasonable case for changes in replicative cells having a deleterious effect on dependent tissues composed of nonreplicative cells (Fossel, pp. 127-128, 186; see also Chang and Harley, pp. 11190-11194). Could this relationship account for mitochondrial damage in the latter? For example, could decreased blood flow to the heart due to atherosclerosis cause greater free radical induced damage to the heart muscle cells? This example may represent a special case which is a complex interaction beginning with free radicals causing damage to endothelial cells of the arteries, shortened telomeres due to proliferation of those cells, inability to repair the damage due to cellular senescence, and atherosclerosis which affects the heart, with possible increase in reactive oxygen species in the heart. A similar effect may be caused by microvascular disease. However, in cases of damage to postmitotic cells in tissues which depend on proliferative cells, the initial factor is free radicals, not senescent gene expression.\n\nIn Fossel's opinion significant accumulation of mitochondrial damage would not occur without senescent gene expression (personal communication). He believes that the cellular germ line has descended from the beginning of life, or at least since the beginning of mitochondrial symbiosis in eukaryotes, without accumulating mitochondrial DNA damage. He points to the lack of damage in unicellular life. To a certain degree age is practically meaningless in one-celled organisms:daughter cells are really the same age as their mother cells. He views multicellular life as a continuum of unicellular life, so that in a sense we are all about 3.5 billion years old. He asks, \". . . if mitochondrial damage goes up exponentially, then why does it do so 'instantly' after incurring essentially no damage for the first 3.5 billion years\" (personal communication). According to Fossel the mitochondrial DNA damage which accumulates in the lifetime of individuals now is due to the initiating effect of senescent gene expression which results from telomere shortening.\n\nA differing view would be that mitochondrial DNA damage has occurred since the first mitochondrion came into existence. To think that the germ line has continued pristine and inviolate since the beginning of life is a misconception. DNA damage, mutation, and evolution are all part of the same process. The DNA damage does not seem to have accumulated due to the Darwinian process of natural selection. Linnane et al pointed out that \"The accumulation of mtDNA mutations in the reproductive germ cell line would also probably result in the formation of non-functional gametes, or non-viable zygotes after fertilization\" (Linnane, et al, p. 644). Mitochondrial DNA damage in the germ line is usually not transmitted beyond the first generation because of the poor health of the individuals inheriting such mutations. Inherited mitochondrial mutations cdo continue to occur as demonstrated by the existence of primary mitochondrial diseases (Luft, pp. 1-6; Scholte, pp. 161-191). Mitochondrial DNA mutations were found to occur in yeast at a much higher rate than in nuclear DNA. The petite mitochondrial mutation occurred at a rate of 10-1 to 10-3 compared to 10-14 to10-16 for nuclear DNA (Linnane, et al, p. 643). The high rate of mitochondrial DNA damage that is exhibited in human postmitotic cardiac cells is not a recent biological innovation. This type of mutation occurs in more primitive forms of life, and always has. Unicellular life which inherits mitochondrial mutations does not survive unless the mutation is advantageous or at least permissive. A significant difference between unicellular and multicellular organisms is that in multicellular life cells with damaged DNA may still allow the organism to continue to exist due to the support of other less damaged cells. This support allows some cells to accumulate mitochondrial DNA damage during the life of the individual until the damage is too great for the organism to survive. On the other hand if a one-celled organism suffers too much damage, it dies. If a strain or species accumulates too many disadvantageous mutations, the strain or species becomes extinct. Successful evolutionary mutations have obviously occurred because human mitochondria are not the same as in one-celled eukaryotic life forms. The fact that most mitochondrial proteins are controlled by nuclear genes is additional evidence of evolutionary change and that the germ line has not continued without alteration. Perhaps in mammals inherited mitochondrial DNA damage is minimized because: (1) mitochondria are inherited only from the female parent; (2) the female's ova are produced while she, herself, is still a fetus; (3) metabolic activity in the ova might be minimal until fertilization; (4) production of free radicals might also be reduced; and (5) the function of the gamete or the viability of the zygote would be compromised by damaged mitochondrial DNA. The validity of the third and fourth items is subject to confirmation. At the same time as ova are presumably dormant, other cells are metabolically active and are accumulating mitochondrial DNA damage.\n\nCancer cells have reached and passed the point of cellular senescence. Do they exhibit senescent gene expression? If so, have they incurred significant mitochondrial DNA damage as would be expected if senescent gene expression is the primary cause of such damage? If they demonstrate the effects of senescent gene expression but do not contain significant mitochondrial DNA damage, the postulation that mitochondrial DNA damage in aged individuals is caused by senescent gene expression would be subject to question. However, when cancer cells avoided cellular senescence they may have also avoided senescent gene expression. It is also possible that due to the lack of the selective process of apoptosis mitochondrial DNA damage might accumulate in cancer cells with or without senescent gene expression.\n\nIf mitochondrial DNA damage caused by free radicals were accumulated with age solely in proportion to the quantity of ATP produced, without modification by other factors (antioxidants, the free radical multiplying effect of DNA damage, mitochondrial dysfunction due to senescent gene expression, and viable cellular selection due to apoptosis), the following graph would illustrate the results:\n\nNaturally the other factors play a significant role so that the following graph is more representative of reality except for the exclusion of apoptotic selection (SGE = Senescent Gene Expression):\n\nThis illustration is similar to published graphs based on actual data (Ozawa, p. 183; Hayakawa, et al, 1992, p. 982; Hayakawa, et al, 1996, p. 375; Katsumata, et al, p. 106). The two curves represent the accumulation of mitochondrial DNA damage with age with and without the effects of senescent gene expression (SGE), if any, on mitochondrial function. If these effects are of major significance, then the curve on the right should be pushed farther to the right, and it should rise at a slower rate. If, however, the effects of senescent gene expression are of lesser significance, then the two curves should be closer together or merge s one. Logic alone cannot determine which of the interpretations presented here is valid. Laboratory research and experiments are needed to answer the questions raised.\n\nIn the literature reviewed those studying mitochondrial damage say little or nothing about telomeres or cell replication, and those investigating telomeres say little about mitochondrial damage. Research is needed to determine the relationships between both areas. Most of the research on mitochondria seems to involve the terminally differentiated cells of heart muscles, brain neurons, and diaphragm muscles. What mitochondrial damage occurs with increasing age in replicative cells such as fibroblasts? Does it correlate with changes in telomere length? Both kinds of analyses should be performed on the same cell sample from the same subject. As replicating cells approach senescence the rate of cell division decreases and finally stops (Cristofalo, et al, p. 429). Could this slow down in cell division be due to decreased output of energy in the form of ATP from mitochondria which are becoming dysfunctional? What mitochondrial damage is found in \"immortal\" HeLa cancer cells donated by Henrietta:Lacks more than 45 years ago? These cells are immortal due to the expression of telomerase, but if mitochondrial DNA damage is a function of age, how could cancer cells be immortal? Do cancer cells show mitochondrial DNA deletion? Perhaps some cancer cells seem to be immortal because their energy requirements are much lower than that of heart muscle cells, and therefore they generate fewer free radicals to cause mitochondrial DNA damage. Does mitochondrial damage occur primarily in non-replicative cells which have high energy requirements (i.e., heart and brain cells)?\n\nAn in vitro research project which could help answer some of the questions raised here would include the following objectives: (1) to determine if mitochondrial damage occurs in proliferating cells at the same rate as in quiescent cells; (2) to determine if mitochondrial damage occurs at the same rate in quiescent cells as in postmitotic cells; (3) to determine if the production of free radicals is directly proportional to the production of ATP until significant mitochondrial damage occurs; (4) to determine if the generation of mitochondrial damage is directly proportional to the production of free radicals; (5) to determine if the available reactive oxygen species increase when the production of endogenous antioxidants is suppressed; (6) to determine if mitochondrial damage increases when antioxidants are suppressed; (7) to determine if the rate of apoptosis increases with an increase in mitochondrial free radicals; (8) to determine if the rate of cell division increases with an increase in mitochondrial free radicals; (9) to determine the proportion of mitogenic effects due to free radicals; (10) to determine if loss of telomere length is directly proportional to the amount of mitochondrial free radicals produced; and (11) to determine if the senescent gene expression resulting from shortened telomeres causes an increase in the production of mitochondrial free radicals and mitochondrial DNA damage.\n\nThe final objective listed would be particularly difficult to accomplish. If senescent gene expression causes an increase in the production of free radicals, these and mitochondrial DNA damage would appear in senescent cells. However, mitochondrial DNA damage and the resultant increase in free radical production would be expected to occur because the damage-limiting process of apoptotic selection would no longer pertain. How can the two possible causes be distinguished? If senescent gene expression causes an increase in free radical production, then senescent cells should exhibit a higher rate of generation of free radicals than quiescent cells. Unfortunately, considering the studies of Ozawa and his colleagues at the University of Nagoya, such observations might require 90 years to obtain results, thereby taxing the patience of any researcher. If the process is accelerated by suppressing the quantity of endogenous antioxidants, the resulting increase in free radicals might mask any difference due to the factors of interest. From analysis of mitochondrial DNA damage in apoptotic cells and the rate of apoptosis a calculated value for damage in senescent cells could be derived, but the problems of time or the masking effect of an accelerated approach persist. Studies need to be conducted to determine if there is a decrease in the quantity of mRNA for mitochondrial proteins encoded by nuclear DNA in senescent cells. Proteins which are most likely to affect metabolism and free radical generation should be given priority. A significant change in such proteins with the onset of cellular senescence would be prima facie evidence for senescent gene expression being the cause of putative mitochondrial DNA damage accumulating in senescent cells. Lack of such a change would indicate the opposite.\n\nParameters for the research project should include: (1) all experiments should use human fetal or neonatal cells which are cloned from the same source; (2) fibroblast cells would probably be appropriate and would have the advantage of having been used extensively in other research; (3) human cardiac muscle cells could be used for experiments requiring terminally differentiated cells; (4) the conditions for each experiment should be identical to all others with respect to temperature, pH, and nutrients, except as noted; (5) all experiments should include analyses of telomere length, mitochondrial damage, rate of production of reactive oxygen species, endogenous antioxidants, rate of production of ATP, rate of apoptosis, and rate of cell division; (6) the analyses listed should be performed at regular intervals several times during the tests, not only at the beginning and end. Mitochondrial damage in the control groups is expected to be minimal or even undetectable. Alteration of mitochondrial guanine to 8-hydroxy-guanine in cardiac muscle cells only reached about 1.5% in a 97 year old, and mitochondrial DNA deletion reached about 7% in the same individual (Ozawa, pp. 183-185). The proposed tests are not expected to last as long. The experiments to be performed should include the following:\n\na. Control group 1. These cells should be allowed to proliferate under optimal growth conditions until they reach senescence and finally death. Measurement of the rate of cell division at several stages in this group is important. Production of ATP should be optimal. Any change in production of mitochondrial free radicals after cellular senescence should be identified if possible. Mitochondrial DNA damage should be compared before and after cellular senescence.\nb. Control group 2. These cells should be maintained under identical conditions as control group 1, except that all cell division should be prevented.\nc. Control group 3. These cells should be maintained under identical conditions as control group 1, except that proliferation should be permissive. All mitogenic factors should be inhibited except for the effect of free radicals. There is a very fine distinction between this group and control group 2. An objective of tests described below will be to determine if free radicals are mitogenic; therefore this control group is needed for comparison.\nd. Control group 4. Terminally differentiated cells should be maintained under identical conditions as control groups 1 and 2 with optimal production of ATP.\ne. Experiment 1. Cells in this group should be maintained under conditions identical to control group 1, except that production of endogenous antioxidants should be suppressed, with tests performed at several levels. Production of ATP should be identical to that in all of the control groups. The available reactive oxygen species are expected to increase in this experiment as compared to control group 1, which should give accelerated results as compared to in vivo analysis. Mitochondrial DNA damage is also expected to increase. Comparison with control group 1 should also provide data on the relative rates of apoptosis, cell division, and telomere loss. Comparison with experiment 2 should aid in determining if the rate of mitochondrial damage is different between proliferating and quiescent cells.\nf. Experiment 2. Cells in this group should be maintained under conditions identical to control group 2, except that production of endogenous antioxidants should be suppressed, with tests performed at several levels as in experiment 1. Production of ATP should be identical to that in all of the control groups. Comparison with experiment 1 should aid in determining if the rate of mitochondrial damage is different between proliferating and quiescent cells. Comparison with experiment 5 should reveal whether the rate of mitochondrial damage in quiescent cells is different from postmitotic cells. Cell division and telomere loss should not occur. The effect on apoptosis, if any, is unknown.\ng. Experiment 3. Cells in this group should be maintained under conditions identical to those in experiment 2 except that the rate of production of ATP should be varied in multiple tests. The purpose of this experiment is to determine how the rate of production of reactive oxygen species varies with change in production of ATP.\nh. Experiment 4. Cells in this group should be maintained under conditions identical to control group 3, except that production of endogenous antioxidants should be suppressed, with tests performed at several levels as in experiment 1. Note that mitogenic effects other than those caused by free radicals (if any) should be suppressed as much as possible. Assuming that the rate of production of free radicals is directly proportional to the rate of production of ATP (to be determined in experiment 3), the production of ATP should be varied in multiple tests as in experiment 3. Production of free radicals would be expected to increase relative to ATP as mitochondrial damage occurs. The purpose of this experiment is to determine if varying levels of free radicals results in different rates of cell division. If this is found to be true, then extrapolation of the data to a point of production of zero free radicals might help to determine the proportion of mitogenic effects which are due to free radicals as compared to other mitogenic factors in vitro. To determine the relative effect in vivo is more problematic. The effect of free radicals on apoptosis and on telomere loss should also be measured. If possible, these tests should be continued after cells reach senescence to determine the rate of post-senescent mitochondrial DNA damage.\ni. Experiment 5. Terminally differentiated cardiac muscle cells should be maintained under conditions identical to control group 4 except that production of endogenous antioxidants should be suppressed, with tests performed at several levels as in experiment 1. Comparison of the results with experiment 2 should help determine whether the rate of mitochondrial damage is different from that in quiescent cells.\n\nIf the research project described substantiates the hypothesis outlined earlier, the hypothesis could be described in the following mathematical terms:\n\nA = quantity of ATP produced/T\nC = rate of cell division/T\nD = number of mitochondrial DNA deletions/T\nE = rate of telomere loss/T\nF = free radicals (available reactive oxygen species after effect of antioxidants)/T\nG = number of mutations of mitochondrial guanine to 8-hydroxy-guanine/T\nI = rate of apoptosis due to factors other than free radicals\nL = rate of telomere addition due to telomerase/T\nM = non-free radical mitogenic factors as a function of T\nN = rate of mitochondrial protein alteration due to senescent gene expression/T\nO = quantity of antioxidants in mitochondria during T\nP = rate of apoptosis due to free radicals, as number of cells which die/T\nR = rate of production of reactive oxygen species/T\nS = effect of slowing of rate of cell division as cells approach senescence\nT = a convenient but specific unit of time\nX = reactive oxygen species neutralized by antioxidants/T\nlower case letters = various factors of unknown value which affect the elements indicated\n\n\nR = pA + yG + zD + mN (assuming rate of production of reactive oxygen species is directly proportional to the rate of production of ATP, plus the added effect of mitochondrial DNA damage, plus the effect of senescent gene expression, if any)\nX = qO (neutralized reactive oxygen species is a function of mitochondrial\nF = R - X (net free radicals after effect of antioxidants)\n= pA + yG + zD + mN - qO\nG = rF (assuming guanine mutations are a function of free radicals)\nD = sF (assuming mitochondrial DNA deletions are a function of free radicals)\nP = tF (assuming the rate of apoptosis is in part a function of free radicals)\nC = uP + vF + kI + wM (assuming the rate of cell division is a function of the\nrate of apoptosis plus any direct effect of free radicals plus the effect of other mitogenic factors)\n= tuF + vF + kI + wM\n= (tu + v)F + kI + wM\nE = xC - S - L (telomere loss is a function of the rate of cell division as adjusted\n= x((tu+v)F + kI + wM) - S - L for slowing on approach of senescence and\nas adjusted for the effect of telomerase, if any)\nN = nE (valid if shortened telomeres have a positional effect on expression of\nnuclear genes controlling production of mitochondrial proteins)\n\nThe next to last formula shows telomere loss to be a function, in part, of the net production of free radicals, according to the hypothesis described above. A diagram showing the key elements of the hypothesis follows:\n\n[Elements of this item are similar to elements of Dr. L. Stephen Coles's item number 5.]\n\n8. What mechanism(s) exist for the repair of mitochondrial DNA damage? Can therapeutic intervention promote this repair?\n\nEvidence of a mitochondrial DNA repair mechanism has been reported (Driggers, et al, pp. 22042-22045; Ames and Shigenaga, p. 88), but elsewhere Ames, Shigenaga, and Hagen refer to a lack of a mitochondrial DNA repair mechanism (pp. 165-166; see also Linnane, et al, p. 642). Yakes and Van Houten found that after exposure of human fibroblast cells to H2O2 for 15 minutes, mitochondrial DNA was damaged, but was then repaired after 1.5 hours; however, if the exposure was for 60 minutes, the damage could not be repaired. Nuclear DNA experienced less damage and was more readily repaired (Yakes and Van Houten, pp. 514-519). In novel in vitro experiments peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) were synthesized to be complementary to human mitochondrial DNA templates which contained a deletion breakpoint or a single base mutation. The PNA bound to the defective mitochondrial DNA and prevented it from replicating while normal DNA was able to replicate. This approach provides for the potential treatment of mitochondrial DNA defects when intracellular heteroplasmy exists (Taylor, et al, pp. 212-215).\n\n9. Would it be feasible to extract mitochondria from cells in which there is little mitochondrial damage, multiply those mitochondria ex vivo, and implant them into high energy cells which have significant mitochondrial damage? Could damaged mitochondria be deleted from the target cells? How could such a procedure be implemented?\n\nProcedures for extracting mitochondria have been described (Kleinsmith and Kish, pp. 137-139, 316). Procedures for transplanting mitochondria have been described in (Coles, pp. 24-25). When yeast cells are cultured under anaerobic conditions their mitochondria seem to disappear; when subsequently exposed to oxygen the mitochondria reappear as promitochondria which can then develop into normal mitochondria (Kleinsmith and Kish, p. 660). If the same results could be obtained with human mitochondria, perhaps the smaller promitochondria could be more readily implanted where needed.\n\n10. Is there a relationship between telomere length and mitochondrial DNA damage in progeric patients and individuals with mitochondrial diseases?\n\nThis issue was stimulated by consideration of short telomeres in progerics (Fossel, pp. 116-117) and a study by Takayuki Ozawa and colleagues of a prematurely aged 19 year old male (Katsumata, et al, pp. 102-110). The telomere information comes from Allsopp et al (pp. 10116-10117) and Goldstein (1978, pp. 177-181, 196-200), who was also a co-author in the Allsopp paper. Goldstein's work includes a nine year old progeric which he had previously described (Goldstein, 1969, p. 424) and two others (Goldstein, 1978, p. 198, as cell population doublings). The Allsopp study was limited to five progerics, only one of whom was fetal or newborn (the same individual was apparently also included in the Goldstein study). Data are also available on a girl who was almost 5 years old (Martin, et al, pp. 88-90) and from 11 progerics ranging in age from 1 to 20 years (Brown, et al, pp. 529-532). In general the 19 individuals included in these studies had shorter telomeres than non-progerics, but there is considerable scatter in the data, and it overlaps with that of normal individuals, particularly in the Brown study (Brown, et al, pp. 529-530). The paucity of data for very young children is very evident. Only two were one year old or less, and one of them had nearly normal length telomeres (Brown, et al, p. 530). Allsopp et al list three possible causes: (1) inheritance of shorter telomeres (favored by Fossel, p. 116), (2) \"a high rate of cell turnover during development,\" or (3) \"an aberrantly high rate of telomere loss with each cell division\" (Allsopp, et al, p. 10116). Allsopp et al eliminated the third possibility in their study, but did not determine which of the other two was preferred. An increased metabolic rate (Goldstein, 1978, p. 179) suggests the possibility of a concurrent increased rate of cell proliferation. At present the cause of shorter telomeres in progerics must be considered as undetermined.\n\nA prematurely aged ninteen year old male was described as having \"the remarkable symptoms of progeria, such as arteriosclerosis, a senile masque, and multiple infarctions in the basal ganglia, which were quite different from those in patients with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy\" (Katsumata, et al, p. 106). They do not specifically state that the patient was a progeric, but merely point out the similarities to progeria. A symptom which was not in accord with progeria was deafness (Goldstein, 1978, pp. 177-180; Katsumata, et al, p. 103; Mills and Weiss, p. 89; Brown, et al, pp. 522-524). The occurrence of convulsions in the patient might also differentiate him from progerics. Goldstein does describe one progeric who died of convulsions (Goldstein, p. 180), but considering the similarity of symptoms with some mitochondrial diseases, that person may have been misdiagnosed. Several symptoms of the Katsumata patient were similar to those of Myoclonus Epilepsy and Ragged Red Fibers syndrome (MERRF), including deafness, convulsions, and ragged red fibers (Katsumata, et al, pp. 103-104; Luft, p. 2). There is considerable overlap between mitochondrial syndromes (Luft, p. 2), and Scholte classified more than 120 varieties (Scholte, pp. 161-191). The diagnosis of the 19 year old male and of a briefly mentioned 17 year old female was mitochondrial cardiomyopathy. Telomere length was not examined in the study, which was limited to terminally differentiated heart muscle cells.\n\nBoth progerics and prematurely aged individuals with mitochondrial diseases need to be studied in a comprehensive manner that includes telomere length, mitochondrial damage, rate of reactive oxygen species production, antioxidant profile, rate of cellular apoptosis, and percent of cells in the G2 or M phase of the cycle.\n\n11. Could the following procedure provide a practical method to prevent organ rejection by a potential recipient?\n\na. Expose a sample of the individual's lymphocytes ex vivo to either a low or high concentration of the antigen(s) of the organ to be transplanted.\nb. Reintroduce the multiplied lymphocytes back into the organ recipient.\n\nExposure of an individual to moderate concentrations of an antigen normally induces an antibody response. However, if the concentrations are either very low or very high, action of T suppressor cells prevents the formation of antibodies (Kleinsmith and Kish, p. 741). Perhaps using a procedure analogous to adoptive immunotherapy (see Old, p. 142), but for the purpose of amplifying T suppressor cells rather than antibody producing lymphocytes, would be an effective method to reduce immune response without using drugs which would weaken the entire immune system. If this method were successful, it could also be used to prevent rejection of viral vectors used in a variety of treatments.\n\n12. Does ingestion of Coenzyme Q-10 extend human life? If so, is there a correlation between dosage and life extension?\n\nIt has already been shown that CoQ-10 significantly extendes lifespan in rodents (Coles and Harris, pp. 205-216). For human trials, large numbers of Japanese have been using Coenzyme Q-10 since the mid 1970's (Bliznakov and Hunt, p. 2; Lee, p. 25). A demographic study of users versus nonusers of coenzyme Q-10 with appropriate consideration of dosage, diet, and the exclusion of smokers could prove valuable. Because Coenzyme Q-10 is known to be beneficial to individuals with cardiac problems, it would be of considerable interest to determine the relative difference in cardiac mitochondrial damage between deceased persons who had regularly used Coenzyme Q-10 and those who had not. Telomere length in replicative cells should also be determined.\n\n\nFor convenience secondary sources were employed in the preparation of this list. Primary sources are obviously preferable.\n\nAll of the topics discussed here need a much more thorough review of the research literature than was performed during the writing of this paper.\n\n\nResearchers should be encouraged to look beyond the narrow focus of their particular interest to include related factors which in combination could be much more significant than any one factor alone. Such factors as telomere length, percent of senescent cells, percent 8-hydroxy-guanine content of mitochondrial DNA, percent mitochondrial DNA deletion, percent of cells in G2 or M phase of the cell cycle, rate of apoptosis, antioxidant levels, and oxidative stress should be considered in conjunction with the primary subject of the research. Inclusion of these and other appropriate factors in scientific studies would facilitate correlation of the multiple factors involved in aging.\n\n\nI would like to thank L. Stephen Coles for his contributions to several sections of this document, for discussing the concepts presented, for his forbearance in tolerating continuous revisions, and for initially suggesting the project. Michael Fossel provided stimulating E-mail discussions and suggestions which were very beneficial. Charles Thomas, Jr., instigated the interest in the mitochondrial theory of aging and assisted with references to the work of Ozawa.\n\n\n  1. Allsopp, Richard C., H. Vaziri, C. Patterson, S.

It also helps us to learn how we develop, and about our relationships with other organisms. Biomedical scientists use cells to look for signs of disease and in new drug development.\n\nPlant and animal cells Almost all organisms are made up of cells. Plant and animal cells have a basic structure.\n\nThe vacuole: \u2022 is surrounded by a membrane and fluid filled \u2022 the fluid is called cell sap \u2022 vacuoles are permanent structures in plants. The nucleus: \u2022 controls the activities of the cell \u2022 contains deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) \u2022 the DNA is organised into chromosomes. The cell membrane: \u2022 controls the passage of substances into and cut of the cell. The cytoplasm: \u2022 is where most of the chemical reactions in the cell take place.\n\n\nThe chloroplasts: \u2022 are found in plant cells above ground \u2022 contain chlorophyll that absorbs the light the plant needs for photoynthesis. The cell wall: \u2022 is an additional layer outside the cell membrane \u2022 is made from cellulose fibres contains fibres that provide \u2022 strength \u2022 unlike the cell membrane, does not regulate what enters or leaves the cell.\n\n\nFigure 1.1 (a) A simple animal cell and (b) a plant leaf cell\n\nThis type of cell, containing a true nucleus in the cytoplasm, is called a eukaryotic cell. 1\n\nList the sub-cellular structures found in both plant and animal cells.\n\n\nWhich sub-cellular structures are found only in plant cells? What is the function of: \u2022 the nucleus \u2022 the cell membrane?\n\n\n\nWhat structure gives strength to a plant cell?\n\nFigure 1.2 Growing cells in a \u00adlaboratory\n\nAQA GCSE Biology for Combined Science: Trilogy: Student Book\n\n75047_P012_047.indd 14\n\n5/20/16 10:04 AM\n\nCell size\n\n\nThe smallest thing we can see is about 0.04 mm, so you can see some of the largest cells with the naked eye. For all cells, however, we need a microscope to see them in any detail. Most animal and plant cells are 0.01\u20130.10 mm in size. The unit we use to measure most cells is the micrometre, symbol \u03bcm. For some sub-cellular structures, or organisms such as viruses, it is best to use a smaller unit: the nanometre, symbol nm. 1 m or 10 \u22123 m 1 millimetre (mm) = 1000 1 mm or 10 \u22123 mm or 10 \u22126 m 1 micrometre (\u03bcm) = 1000 1 \u03bcm or 10 \u22123 \u03bcm or 10 \u22129 m 1 nanometre (nm) = 1000 4\n\nWhat size is the smallest thing our eye can see, in m?\n\n\nWhat is the range in size of most animal and plant cells, in \u03bcm?\n\nOrder of magnitude Figure 1.3 shows the size of plant and animal cells compared with some other structures.\n\nant length 3 mm\n\nhair diameter 100 \u00b5m\n\nleaf cell red blood cell length 70 \u00b5m diameter 7 \u00b5m\n\nbacterium length 1 \u00b5m\n\nvirus 100 nm\n\nDNA diameter 2.5 nm\n\ncarbon atom 0.34 nm\n\nFigure 1.3 Size and scale\n\nWhen comparing the sizes of cells, scientists often refer to differences in order of magnitude. That\u2019s the difference calculated in factors of 10. So, the difference in order of magnitude for the HIV and the plant cell: The plant cell in Figure 1.1b is 100 \u03bcm = 10 -4 m. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is 100 nm = 10 -7 m. The difference in order of magnitude is 103, expressed as 3. 6 7\n\nA cell membrane measures 7 nm across. Convert this to micrometres. A white blood cell measures 1.2 \u00d7 10 \u22125 m. An egg cell measures 1.2 \u00d7 10 \u22124 m. Calculate the difference in order of magnitude.\n\nREMEMBER! You\u2019ll notice that this system of units uses, and gives names to, multiples and sub-multiples of units at intervals of thousands (103) or thousandths (10 \u22123). A common exception is the centimetre, 1 or 100\n\n10 \u22122 of a metre. But it is often convenient to use centimetres, particularly in everyday life.\n\nGoogle search: 'animal cells, plant cells, calculating order of magnitude, cell size'\n\n75047_P012_047.indd 15\n\n\n5/20/16 10:04 AM\n\n\nThe light microscope Learning objectives: \u2022 observe plant and animal cells with a light microscope \u2022 understand the limitations of light microscopy.\n\nKey words magnification micrographs resolving power\n\nThe type of light microscope you have used in the school laboratory is called a compound microscope. Microscopes magnify the specimen you are looking at, making them look bigger than they are.\n\nSome early microscopes had just a single lens. The compound microscope has two. As lens-making techniques improved, microscopes were developed with higher magnifications and resolutions. Figure 1.4 A compound microscope\n\nMagnification The magnified image is produced by two lenses, an eyepiece and an objective lens. There is usually a choice of objective lenses. Total magnification = magnification of eyepiece \u00d7 \u2003\u2003\u2009magnification of objective lens For instance, if the eyepiece has a magnification of 10, which is written \u00d7 10, and the objective lens has a magnification of \u00d7 40, the total magnification is \u00d7 400.\n\n\n\nCalculate the total magnification with an eyepiece magnification of \u00d7 15 and an objective lens magnification of \u00d7 40.\n\n\nWhat magnification would the objective lens need to be to give a total magnification of \u00d7 300 with an eyepiece of \u00d7 15?\n\nDid you know? British scientist Robert Hooke first used the term \u2018cell\u2019. He recorded the first drawings of cells using a compound microscope in his book Micrographia, which was 350 years old in 2015. You may also have heard of Hooke for his law of elasticity, Hooke\u2019s law, in physics.\n\nAQA GCSE Biology for Combined Science: Trilogy: Student Book\n\n75047_P012_047.indd 16\n\n5/20/16 10:04 AM\n\nMagnification of images\n\n\nThe magnification described on the previous page is the magnification used to view an image. Microscope images, or micrographs, in books, scientific papers or exam papers must show the magnification in order to be meaningful. magnification of the image =\n\nsize of the image size of real object\n\nThe cell in Figure 1.5 is 50 mm across on the page. In real life, it measures 40 \u03bcm.\n\n40 \u00b5m\n\nTo calculate the magnification, first convert the 50 mm into micrometres (or convert 40 \u03bcm to millimetres). 50 mm = 50 000 \u03bcm The cell measures 40 \u03bcm Therefore, the magnification of the image =\n\nFigure 1.5 A drawing of a micrograph of a cell\n\n50 000 = \u00d7 1250. 40\n\n\nA micrograph of a plant cell in a book is 150 mm long. The plant cell measures 120 \u03bcm long. Calculate the magnification.\n\n\nWhy is it essential to state the magnification of an image of a cell in a book but of little value on a website?\n\nThe limits of the light microscope Very high magnifications are not possible with the light microscope. This is because of the light-gathering ability of the microscope and the short working distances of high-power lenses. The highest magnification possible is around \u00d7 1500. Using higher magnification does not always mean that you can see greater detail in an image. This depends on the resolving power, or resolution. This is the ability to distinguish between two points. In other words, whether you see them as two points, or one. The resolving power of a light microscope is around 0.2 \u03bcm, or 200 nm. This means that you could not separately pick out two points closer than 200 nm apart. 5\n\nWhat is the maximum resolving power of the light microscope?\n\n\nWhat is the maximum magnification possible with a light microscope?\n\nFigure 1.6\u2002 A micrograph of the cross section of a root. Magnification \u00d7 100\n\nCOMMON MISCONCEPTIONS Do not confuse magnification, which is how much bigger we can make something appear, with resolving power, which is the level of detail we can see. Think about a digital photo. You can make it as big as you like, but at a certain point you will not be able to see any more detail.\n\nGoogle search: 'magnification, resolving power'\n\n75047_P012_047.indd 17\n\n\n5/20/16 10:05 AM\n\n\nLooking at cells in more detail Learning objectives: \u2022 identify the differences in the magnification and resolving power of light and electron microscopes \u2022 explain how electron microscopy has increased our understanding of sub-cellular structures.\n\nKey words scanning electron \u2002 microscope (SEM) transmission \u2002electron \u2002 microscope (TEM)\n\nThe transmission electron microscope (TEM) uses an electron beam instead of light rays. Some of the electrons are scattered as they pass through the specimen. Those able to pass through it are focused in TEMs using electromagnetic coils instead of lenses.\n\nElectron microscopes TEMs are used for looking at extremely thin sections of cells. The highest magnification that can be obtained from a transmission electron microscope is around \u00d7\u20091 000 000, but images can also be enlarged photographically. The limit of resolution of the transmission electron microscope is now less than 1 nm.\n\nFigure 1.7 A transmission \u00adelectron \u00admicroscope. The electrons are \u00addisplayed as an image on a \u00adfluorescent screen.\n\nThe scanning electron microscope (SEM) works by bouncing electrons off the surface of a specimen that has had an ultrathin coating of a heavy metal, usually gold, applied. A narrow electron beam scans the specimen. Images are formed by these scattered electrons. SEMs are used to reveal the surface shape of structures such as small organisms and cells. Because of this, resolution is lower and magnifications used are often lower than for a TEM. Electrons do not have a colour spectrum like the visible light used to illuminate a light microscope. They can only be \u2018viewed\u2019 in black and white. Here, false colours have been added.\n\n\n\nWhat is the maximum resolution of an electron microscope?\n\n\nWhat types of samples would a TEM and an SEM be used to view?\n\n\nHow has electron microscopy improved our understanding of cells?\n\nFigure 1.8 A scanning electron \u00admicrograph of a cancer cell\n\nAQA GCSE Biology for Combined Science: Trilogy: Student Book\n\n75047_P012_047.indd 18\n\n5/20/16 10:05 AM\n\nCell ultrastructure\n\n\nThe TEM reveals tiny sub-cellular structures that are not visible with the light microscope.

Mitochondria and chloroplasts vary in size and shape. The complexity of a mitochondrion indicates how active a cell is. Chloroplast size varies from one species to another. Scientists sometimes investigate the ratio of the area of the cytoplasm to that of the nucleus in micrographs. A high ratio of cytoplasmic:nuclear volume can indicate that the cell is about to divide. A low one can be characteristic of a cancer cell. 4\n\nName one structure visible using the electron microscope, but not the light microscope.\n\n\nWhat process happens in ribosomes?\n\nDon\u2019t assume that we always use electron microscopes in preference to light microscopes, or that electron microscopes are always used at high magnifications. Confocal microscopy is used in a lot of biomedical research. It can give high resolution images of live cells. And SEM is often used at low magnifications.\n\nDid you know? Three scientists won the Nobel Prize in 2014 for the development of superresolved fluorescence microscopy. It allows a much higher resolution than normal light microscopy. And, unlike electron microscopy, it has the advantage of allowing scientists to look at living cells.\n\nGoogle search: 'scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy'\n\n75047_P012_047.indd 19\n\n\n5/20/16 10:06 AM\n\n\nREQUIRED PRACTICAL Using a light microscope to observe and record animal and plant cells\n\nKey words field of view scale bar\n\nLearning objectives: \u2022 apply knowledge to select techniques, instruments, apparatus and materials to observe cells \u2022 make and record observations and measurements \u2022 present observations and other data using appropriate methods.\n\nThese pages are designed to help you think about aspects of the investigation rather than to guide you through it step by step.\n\nMany scientists use electron microscopes to observe fine detail in cells. But much of the microscope work carried out \u2013 including in hospital and forensic science labs \u2013 is done with the light microscope.\n\nPreparing cells for microscopy Live cells can be mounted in a drop of water or saline on a microscope slide. Most cells are colourless. We must stain them to add colour and contrast. In the school laboratory, you may have used methylene blue to stain animal cells or iodine solution to stain plant cells. 1\n\nWrite an equipment list for looking at cheek cells with a microscope.

It\u2019s usual to add a magnification to the image. We can then envisage, or work out, the true size of a specimen. Alternatively, we can use a scale bar. Any scale bar must be: \u2022 drawn for an appropriate dimension \u2022 a sensible size in relation to the image. Look at Figure 1.14. For the top micrograph, the magnification of \u00d7 1000 means that a 10 millimetre scale bar can be drawn to represent 10 micrometres. You will find out how scientists measure, or sometimes estimate, the size of cells in section 1.14. 7\n\nComplete the scale bar for the bottom micrograph.\n\n\nCalculate the length of the Paramecium in Figure 1.14.\n\nFigure 1.14 Light microscopy is also used to examine small organisms such as protists.

It confirms that there were bacteria living around 3.5 billion years ago. The bacteria probably formed thin purple and green mats on shorelines. The bacteria would have photosynthesised, but produced sulfur as waste instead of oxygen.\n\nProkaryotic cells Bacteria are among the simplest of organisms. Along with bacteria-like organisms called archaeans, they belong to a group of organisms called the Prokaryota. These are single cells with a prokaryotic cell structure. The cells of most types of organisms \u2013 such as all animals and plants \u2013 are eukaryotic. These have a cell membrane, cytoplasm containing sub-cellular structures called organelles and a nucleus containing DNA. ribosomes\n\n\nFigure 1.15 The organisms in this fossil are similar to purple bacteria that are living today.\n\nsingle loop of DNA not enclosed in a nucleus\n\nSome bacteria have a flagellum for movement.\n\nThe cell wall may be surrounded by a capsule. cell wall cell membrane Small ring of DNA called a plasmid (one or more in a cell).

Their DNA is not enclosed in a nucleus. It is found as a single molecule in a loop. They may also have one or more small rings of DNA called plasmids. 1\n\nList the differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.\n\n\nWhere is DNA found in prokaryotic cells?\n\nA new classification system By the 1970s, biologists had classified living organisms into five kingdoms. Very small, microscopic organisms called archaeans were originally grouped in a kingdom with bacteria. But in 1977, American microbiologist Carl Woese suggested that certain types of organisms that lived in extreme environments or produced methane gas should be placed in a separate group.\n\nDid you know? A \u2018superfood\u2019 called Spirulina is the dried cells of a blue-green bacterium. The cells contain high concentrations of protein, and are rich in essential fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.\n\nArchaea Eukaryota\n\n\nanimals fungi plants\n\nWoese suggested that living things should be divided into three groups called domains: Bacteria, Archaea and Eukaryota. 3\n\nWhat are the three domains of living things?\n\n\nIn which domain are plants and animals?\n\ncommon ancestor\n\nFigure 1.17 The three-domain \u00adclassification system\n\nChemical characteristics of archaeans Acceptance of Woese\u2019s theory was a slow process. Even today, not everyone agrees with it, but chemical analyses have supported the idea that archaeans should be in a separate domain. The ribosomes of archaeans are similar in size and structure to those of bacteria, but the nucleic acid in these structures is closer to that of eukaryotes. When American biochemist Craig Ventner, one of the first scientists involved in the sequencing of the human genome, looked at the DNA of Archaea he was astounded to find that \u2018two-thirds of the genes [in Archaea] do not look like anything we\u2019ve ever seen in biology before\u2019.\n\nFigure 1.18 Archaeans live in extreme \u00adenvironments, such as hot springs and salt lakes. Some produce methane and are i\u00admportant in the carbon cycle.\n\n\nWhere do archaeans live?\n\n\nWhat evidence suggests that archaeans should be placed in a separate domain from bacteria?\n\nYou should aim to be able to discuss how information on Archaea, Bacteria and Eukaryota allows them to be placed in separate domains.\n\nGoogle search: 'Archaea, bacteria, eukaryotic, plasmid, prokaryotic, Carl Woese'\n\n75047_P012_047.indd 23\n\n\n5/20/16 10:07 AM\n\n\nCell division\n\nKey words\n\nLearning objectives:\n\ndaughter cell mitosis stem cells\n\n\u2022 describe the process of mitosis in growth, and mitosis as part of the cell cycle \u2022 describe how the process of mitosis produces cells that are genetically identical to the parent cell.\n\nAs an adult, we are made up of 37 trillion (3.7 \u00d7 1013) cells. To produce these cells, the fertilised egg needs to undergo many cell divisions. 1\n\n\nChromosomes As we grow, the cells produced by cell division must all contain the same genetic information.\n\n\n\nThe genetic information of all organisms is contained in chromosomes, made of DNA. The DNA in resting cells is found in the nucleus as long, thin strands. For cell division, these strands form condensed chromosomes.\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman body cells have 46 chromosomes, or 23 pairs.

Two daughter cells are produced from the parent cell.\n\nThe chromosomes in the photograph are cut out and arranged into pairs. The pairs are arranged so that Pair 1 has the longest chromosomes; Pair 22 the shortest Pair 23 is the sex chromosomes.\n\nFor some cell types, new cells are produced by the division of stem cells (discussed later in the chapter).\n\nFigure 1.19 A profile of a set of \u00adchromosomes, called a karyotype\n\n\nWhen are new cells produced?\n\n\nIn this type of cell division: \u2022 how many chromosomes do daughter cells have? \u2022 how many daughter cells are produced?\n\n\nMAKING CONNECTIONS To come up with a figure for how many cells there are in the human body, scientists must estimate the number by adding up cell counts from different organs.\n\nAQA GCSE Biology for Combined Science: Trilogy: Student Book\n\n75047_P012_047.indd 24\n\n\nThe chromosom cut out and arra The pairs are ar longest chromos Pair 23 is the se\n\nA photograph is taken of a dividing cell.\n\n\n\n\n5/20/16 10:07 AM\n\n\nSo that the daughter cells produced are identical to the parent cell, the DNA must first copy itself.

Each half has an identical set of genes.\n\nFigure 1.20 It is these \u2018double\u2019 chromosomes that we always see in micrographs or illustrations of chromosomes.\n\nDuring mitosis, the double chromosomes are pulled apart as each new set of 46 chromosomes moves to opposite ends of the cell (Figure 1.21). Two nuclei then form. The cytoplasm and cell membrane then divides and two cells are produced. 5\n\nWhy do chromosomes appear double, or X-shaped, in micrographs?\n\nThe cell cycle A cell that is actively dividing goes through a series of stages called the cell cycle. The cycle involves the growth of the cell and the production of new cell components and division.\n\nFigure 1.21 Mitosis in an onion cell\n\n1. The cell grows.

It is estimated, however, that four in ten cases of cancer could be prevented by lifestyle changes.\n\nWhat is cancer? Normally, cells grow and divide by mitosis when the body needs new cells to replace old or damaged cells. When a cell becomes cancerous, it begins to divide uncontrollably. New cells are produced even though the body does not need them. The extra cells produced form growths called tumours. Most tumours are solid, but cancers of the blood, for instance leukaemia, are an exception. 1\n\nWhat is cancer?\n\n\nName one type of cancer that does not form a solid tumour.\n\nFigure 1.28 A CT scanner, used to detect cancer\n\nTypes of tumour Type of tumour\n\n\n\n\u2022 slow growing \u2022 often have a capsule around them, so can be removed easily \u2022 not cancerous and rarely spread to other parts of the body \u2022 they can press on other body organs and look unsightly.\n\n\n\u2022 grow faster \u2022 can spread throughout other body tissues \u2022 as the tumour grows, cancer cells detach and can form secondary tumours in other parts of the body.\n\nMalignant cells develop.\n\nThe tumour secretes hormone-like chemicals.\n\nThe malignant cells divide and can invade normal tissues.\n\nBlood vessels are stimulated to grow around the tumour; the blood vessels supply the tumour with food and oxygen.\n\nMalignant cells detach from the tumour and are transported away in the blood.\n\nMalignant cells can detach from the tumour and spread to other parts of the body.\n\nThe malignant cell squeezes through the capillary wall.\n\nThe cell divides to produce a secondary tumour.\n\nFigure 1.29 The growth and spread of a tumour\n\n\nAQA GCSE Biology for Combined Science: Trilogy: Student Book\n\n75047_P012_047.indd 28\n\n5/20/16 10:08 AM\n\n\nName two types of tumour.\n\n\nExplain why a tumour needs a blood supply.\n\n\nWhat is the name of the type of tumour formed when a cancer spreads?\n\nWhat triggers cancer? Chemicals and other agents that cause cancer are called carcinogens. Carcinogens cause cancer by damaging DNA. A change in the DNA of a cell is called a mutation. Mutations can also occur by chance as a cell is dividing.\n\nDid you know? Many treatments for cancer come from plants, such as the Pacific yew and the Madagascan periwinkle. These drugs work by interfering with mitosis.\n\nThere are natural checks for such errors during the cell cycle. Some of our genes suppress developing tumours.\n\n\nSeveral mutations, not just one, are necessary to trigger cancer. This is why we are more likely to develop cancer as we get older.\n\n\nMutations that lead to cancer can be caused by several agents:\n\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nviruses (see Figure 1.30). chemicals in the home, industry or environment ionising radiation ultraviolet radiation lifestyle choices, such as alcohol intake or diet (see Figure 1.31).\n\n6000 4000 2000\n\nAnnual number of cases in USA\n\n\nmouth and throat\n\n\n\nvagina and vulva penis\n\n\nBreast cancer death rate per 100 000 female population\n\n30 0\n\nHPV cases\n\n\nnon-HPV cases\n\nFigure 1.30 Cancers caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV)\n\n\n\n\n0 0\n\n\n\n60 80 100 Animal fat intake (g/day)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.31 Scattergraph showing the correlation between breast cancer deaths and animal fat intake.

In the summer of 2015 the NHS announced that it planned to start giving people blood transfusions using artificial blood by 2017.\n\nWhat are stem cells? Stem cells are unspecialised cells that can produce many different types of cells.

Stem cell transplants also enable chemotherapy patients, who have had their bone marrow destroyed, to produce red blood cells. The hope is that we will be able to culture stem cells in limitless numbers. Stem cell lines produced from patients with rare and complex diseases could transform the health service. 3\n\nName two conditions that could be treated with stem cell transplants.\n\n\nWhy are stem cell transplants important for people who have had chemotherapy?\n\nStem cell research and therapy is controversial Stem cell research is necessary to find out more about stem cell development, and the best types to use in treatments. The use of embryonic stem cells, which are removed from a living human embryo, is especially controversial. Until recently, the embryos providing the stem cells were usually those left over from fertility treatments involving in-vitro fertilisation (IVF). Spare embryos would be destroyed if they had not been donated by the IVF couples for research. British law now allows embryos to be created purely for scientific research. Some people object to this. Some religious beliefs argue that new life begins at the point of conception, so an embryo has rights. And who should decide when a human life ends? These are moral and ethical questions. A moral question looks at whether something is right or wrong. An ethical question discusses the reasons why something might be right or wrong. 5\n\nWhy do some people object to stem cell transplants?\n\n\nWrite down one ethical objection to stem cell research.\n\nFigure 1.34 Embryonic stem cells\n\nDid you know? Stem cell transplants are not new. Transplants of bone marrow, which contain stem cells, have been carried out since 1968. But there are very few stem cells in bone marrow (only 1 in 10 000 bone marrow cells). We currently isolate these from blood, rather than bone marrow.\n\nKEY INFORMATION Current potential for adult stem cell use in therapies is restricted to certain cell lines, but it may be greater than once thought. Scientists are trying to induce them to differentiate into a wider range of tissues, a process called transdifferentiation.\n\nGoogle search: 'adult stem cells, bone marrow stem cells, embryonic stem cells, umbilical cord blood cells'\n\n75047_P012_047.indd 31\n\n\n5/20/16 10:08 AM\n\n\nStem cell banks Learning objectives: \u2022 discuss potential benefits and risks associated with the use of stem cells in medicine.\n\nKey words donor gene mutation therapeutic \u2002cloning umbilical cord\n\nScientists predict that, in the future, vast banks of stored stem cells will be available to treat many medical conditions.\n\nFigure 1.35 Stem cells can be stored in liquid nitrogen.\n\nRejection of stem cell transplants The stem cells from a bank originate from many different people. Rejection of stem cell transplants by a patient\u2019s immune system is, therefore, a problem. One current solution is to find as close a match as possible between donor and patient cells. Another is to give the patient drugs to suppress their immune system. Scientists are looking for other ways to avoid transplant rejection. One possible source of stem cells is blood left in the umbilical cord and placenta after a baby is born. Cord blood is easy to collect and store.\n\n\n\nSuggest sources of stem cells that would give the best match between donor and patient.\n\n\nSuggest some possible advantages and disadvantages of having a baby\u2019s blood stored to treat possible disease or injury in later life.\n\nAQA GCSE Biology for Combined Science: Trilogy: Student Book\n\n75047_P012_047.indd 32\n\n5/20/16 10:09 AM\n\nTherapeutic cloning\n\n\nThe idea of therapeutic cloning is to produce stem cells with the same genes as the patient. They would not be rejected by the patient\u2019s immune system. The process involves nuclear transfer. The nucleus of a body cell from the patient is transferred to an egg cell that has had its nucleus removed. nucleus is removed human egg cell\n\ncell from patient\n\nAfter 4\u20135 days stem cells are removed.\n\nCell is stimulated to divide. nucleus from patient\u2019s cell\n\nEmbryo produced is grown.\n\nStem cells from the embryo are cultured.\n\nFigure 1.36 Therapeutic cloning\n\nDid you know?\n\nThe stem cells are used to treat the patient. The embryo is discarded. 3\n\nWhat is therapeutic cloning?\n\n\nWhen are stem cells removed from the embryo?\n\nScientific, ethical and social questions\n\nScientists have succeeded in removing human skin cells and reprogramming them to become cells similar to embryonic stem cells. This removes some of the ethical concerns over stem cell transplants.\n\nMany questions arise from therapeutic cloning and stem cell therapy. The first scientific question is how successful might these therapies be? Others consider safety: stem cells kept in culture can show similarities to cancer cells. After about 60 cell divisions, mutations have been observed. It is also possible for viruses to be transferred with stem cells, leading to infection. There are also ethical questions: \u2022 Is it morally right to create an embryo with the intent of destroying it? \u2022 Could an embryo simply become a resource for researchers? There are also important social questions. What are the potential benefits from successful stem cell treatment and do these outweigh the objections? Public education on this issue is important. There is no evidence that human embryos have, so far, been produced for therapeutic cloning. 5\n\nSuggest two questions scientists might have about therapeutic cloning.\n\n\nDiscuss the ethical concerns about therapeutic cloning.\n\nFigure 1.37 Blind patients have had their sight restored by stem cells.

These processes are closely linked, and are a key focus for current biological research.\n\nCells The cell is the basic unit of life.

This cell develops into an adult with trillions of cells. As new cell components are added, and the cell reaches a certain size, it divides by mitosis. Mitosis occurs in several other situations: \u2022 to replace cells when they die or become damaged\n\n\nAQA GCSE Biology for Combined Science: Trilogy: Student Book\n\n75047_P012_047.indd 34\n\n5/20/16 12:46 PM\n\n\n1.11 \u2022 when single-celled, eukaryotic organisms reproduce by asexual reproduction, for example yeast \u2022 when cancer cells divide \u2022 when eukaryotic cells are cloned. When an organism reproduces sexually, the sex cells, or gametes, cannot be produced by mitosis. If they were, the number of chromosomes in our cells would double every generation! We need another type of cell division, called meiosis. 3\n\nGive three examples of situations in which mitosis occurs.\n\n\nName one type of cell that does not divide by mitosis.\n\nCell differentiation Cells must become specialised for the development of complex, multicellular organisms. Cells that can differentiate into other cell types are called stem cells. Embryonic stem cells, found after four to fi ve days, can develop into almost any cell type. We can\u2019t say \u2018all\u2019, as they can\u2019t develop into cells of the placenta. Stem cells have the potential to produce an unlimited amount of tissue for transplants. They are also important in medical research such as on how cells differentiate, and in the testing of drugs. Stem cell research and treatments will require the cloning of cells. Some people object to the idea of these techniques for moral and ethical reasons. Cancer cells divide uncontrollably by mitosis and do not differentiate into mature, specialised cells. Cancer cells early in the development of the disease can look almost normal, but in advanced cancers, differentiation in most cells is very limited. Perhaps the most important of all cloned cells are HeLa cells. They are the offspring of those removed from a woman dying from cervical cancer in 1951 and have been cloned continually since then. They have been key to our understanding of genetics, cell biology and medicine. 5\n\nWhy are some news articles that suggest that embryonic stem cells can differentiate into all cell types, strictly speaking, incorrect?\n\n\nWhat type of human cells were the first to be cloned successfully?

Energy is needed to make our muscles contract and to keep our bodies warm. It\u2019s also needed to transport substances around the bodies of animals and plants. In other sections of the book, you will also find out that energy is needed:\n\nFigure 1.39 An average runner uses around 13 000 kJ of energy for a marathon.\n\n\u2022 for cell division \u2022 to maintain a constant environment within our bodies \u2022 for active transport.

Respiration using oxygen is called aerobic respiration. This type of respiration takes place in animal and plant cells, and in many microorganisms. Glucose is a simple sugar. It is the starting point of respiration in most organisms. The food that organisms take in is, therefore, converted into glucose.\n\n\nAQA GCSE Biology for Combined Science: Trilogy: Student Book\n\n75047_P012_047.indd 36\n\n5/20/16 10:10 AM\n\n\nThis chemical reaction is exothermic.

He adds yeast to a mixture of malted barley and hops in water.\n\nFigure 1.42 Yeast converts sugar into alcohol, or ethanol. The process is completed in around 3 days.\n\nAnaerobic respiration The yeast respires using the sugary liquid. The yeast cells divide rapidly. After a few hours there are so many yeast cells that the oxygen runs out. The yeast is able to switch its respiration so that it can obtain energy without oxygen. This is anaerobic respiration \u2013 respiration without oxygen. Anaerobic respiration in yeast cells and certain other microorganisms is called fermentation. Anaerobic respiration occurs in the cytoplasm of cells.\n\n\n\nWhat is meant by anaerobic respiration?\n\n\nWhy is reproduction in yeast mitosis and not binary fission (as you might see it described in some books)?\n\nFigure 1.43 Yeast cells divide rapidly by mitosis.

It produces only around a nineteenth as much energy. But in situations where there\u2019s little oxygen, it means that cells can stay alive, and the amount of energy produced is still enough to keep single cells running. Certain plant cells can also use alcoholic fermentation to obtain their energy. These include plants that grow in marshes, where oxygen is in short supply. Pollen grains can also respire anaerobically. Without oxygen, we would die. But when actively contracting, our muscles run short of oxygen. They are able to respire anaerobically for short periods of time. Lactic acid, and not ethanol, is produced. glucose \u2192 lactic acid (energy released) 6\n\nExplain why it is helpful for pollen grains to respire anaerobically.\n\n\nWrite down the equation for fermentation.\n\n\nFor anaerobic respiration in muscle:\n\nFigure 1.44 Dough is kneaded to mix the ingredients.\n\nDid you know?

This is simply a microscope slide onto which an accurate scale has been etched.

The clinic uses stem cell therapy to treat diabetes and other conditions. The part about differentiation is important.\n\nWhat is a stem cell?\n\n\nAn unspecialised cell that can differentiate, or can be made to differentiate, into many different cell types. The article contains some information on the clinic\u2019s treatment of diabetes.\n\n\nIt includes data on the 55 patients the clinic has treated so far, which it claims is a success. Type of diabetes\n\nOne month after treatment, number of patients who\u2026 showed an improvement\n\nshowed no change\n\nbecame worse\n\nType 1\n\n\n\n\nThe calculations are correct.\n\nType 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe answers have not been recorded consistently, however. Think about significant figures. All the numbers in the table have a maximum of two figures, so you cannot have more in the answer.\n\na\u2002 Calculate the overall percentage of patients who:\n\n\u2022 showed an improvement \u2003\u2003 50.9% \u2022 showed no change\u2003\u2003 40% \u2022 became worse\u2003\u2003 9.1% b\u2002\u0007Does the data support the newspaper article\u2019s claims? Explain your answer.\n\nMy percentages show there is no difference between the overall percentage of patients who showed an improvement and those who did not. The article is certainly untrue for Type 1 diabetes, where only 34.8% improved. It might be true for Type 2, because 62.5% improved.\n\nYou will notice that this question draws on your knowledge of scientific methods as well as stem cells. You may also have to use relevant knowledge from another topic. When you\u2019ve learnt about diabetes, you will be aware that Type 2 diabetes can usually be controlled by diet and exercise, so the \u2018improvements\u2019 suggested by the data may be the result of this.\n\nThe answer draws correct conclusions from the table and uses data to support these. With the small number of patients (23 for Type 1; 32 for Type 2), we cannot draw any firm conclusions from the small d \u00ad ifferences in numbers. Sample size is important in any scientific study.

Blessed in the straight path are the undefiled, who walk according to the law of Iod-Havah.\n2. Blessed are they who keep his testimonies, who seek him with their whole heart.\n3. Such who walk in his path do no iniquity.\n4. You have commanded to carefully keep your precepts.\n5. Oh, that my ways were directed to keep your statutes!\n6. Then shame shall not be on me, when I look at all your commandments.\n7. I will thank you with integrity of heart, when learning the judgments of your righteousness.\n8. I will keep your statutes; do not forsake me utterly.\n\nArcanum 1\n\nFrom Alchemy and Kabbalah by Samael Aun Weor\n\ntarot 1\n\nThis Arcanum is represented by the Magician. The Holy Eight, symbol of the infinite, appears above the head of the Magician; the Holy Eight encloses, defines, and joins the magnetic currents of the mind that deals with dream consciousness with the mind that deals with vigil consciousness. This sign joins or separates all of the elements which are controlled by the atomic energy, if it is traced with the middle finger, index finger and the thumb over the surface of the cardiac plexus.\n\nPRACTICE: According with the former description the following exercise is suggested: Withdraw all type of thoughts from your mind, now imagine the Holy Eight as it is represented in the following graphic:\n\nHoly Eight\n\nAllow the figure itself to submerge within your consciousness and thereafter, while falling asleep, empty your mind, without thinking in anything. Thus after a while, you will awaken your consciousness in the Astral Plane.\n\nIf we consider the formation of this symbol, we see that it illustrates the continuity of only one arm that encloses a double circuit in the beginning of the stroke, while enclosing only one circuit in the continuation of the stroke. Thereafter, the stroke divides the sign at the point where it centrally crosses it and it then continues into the other circuit in order to project itself towards the exterior. One circuit closes and the other opens.\n\nThis is the required key in order to open all the doors and to cut all the currents formed by the atomic energy, beginning with the one that we have imagined and placed within the depth of our consciousness and ending with the one that originated the rest, which circulates in the same manner in the center of the \u201cNinth Sphere.\u201d\n\nNow then, to overcome by means of these requirements the risks per se of every astral experience and thus to obtain a fast and also perfect astral projection is more than enough reason, among other things, in order for the Sacred Order of Tibet to affirm in its motto: \u201cNothing can resist our power.\u201d\n\nThus, moments before lying down in order to perform this practice, the disciple must invoke with all of his heart and with all of his soul , the Great Regent of the Sacred Order of Tibet. The name of this great Guruji is Bhagavan Aklaiva. This Order, that we have the honor of representing here in Mexico, is the most powerful Order of all the Oriental traditions. This Order is formed by 201 members. The major rank is formed by seventy-two Brahmans.\n\nPapus in his \u201cTreatise of Occult Science\u201d stated that the true initiates from the east are the ones who belong to the Secret Sanctuaries of Brahmanism, since they are the only ones who can give us the royal clue of the Arcanum AZF, thanks to their knowledge of the Primeval Atlantean language \u201cWATAN,\u201d the fundamental roots of Sanskrit, Hebrew and Chinese.\n\nThe Sacred Order of Tibet is the genuine owner of the real treasury of Aryavarta. This treasury is the Arcanum A.Z.F.\n\nBhagavan Aklaiva will help you to consciously travel in your astral body. Invoke him when you are meditating on the sacred sign of the infinite. On any given night, you will be invoked from the Temple of the Himalayas; there you will be submitted to \u201cSeven Ordeals.\u201d There you will be taught the Secret Science.\n\nNow then, after this digression, let us continue with our initial point. The Holy Eight symbolizes the Caduceus of Mercury and represents the two ganglionic chords that esoterically are entwined around the spinal medulla, these are: Ida and Pingala; the two witnesses, the olive branches, the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth.\n\nThe solar atoms rise through the cord of the right and the lunar atoms rise through the cord of the left.\n\nThese solar and lunar atoms rise from our seminal system the fire of Phlegethon and the water of Acheron cross in the Ninth Sphere, sex, and form the sign of the Infinite.\n\nF plus A equal C \u2013 Fire plus water equal Consciousness.\n\nWhosoever meditates on the sign of the infinite will utilize the Fire and the Water in order to awaken the Consciousness. Now we understand why the two witnesses of revelation have the power of prophecy.\n\n\nAnd I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth. As we said: \u201cThese are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth. - Revelation 11:3, 4\n\nNow then, the quantity 1260 (a thousand two hundred and threescore days) is Kabbalistically added as follows:\n\n1 plus 2 plus 6 plus 0 = 9; this is the symbol of the Ninth Sphere.\n\nThe Ninth Sphere is sex. The two witnesses have their root in the sex. These two witnesses Ida and Pingala are two fine ganglionic chords through which the solar and lunar atoms of our seminal system ascend to the \u201cchalice.\u201d The chalice is the brain.\n\nFill your chalice, brethren of mine, with the sacred wine of light.\n\nNow you comprehend why the sign of the infinite appears above the head of the magician, and why the sword, the cup and pantacles are before him, and why is he grasping the magic wand that symbolizes the spinal medulla.\n\nWhen the solar and lunar atoms make contact in the coccygeal bone, the Kundalini , the igneous serpent of our magical powers awakens, then we are devour by the serpent and we convert ourselves into excellent divine magicians.\n\nThe Letter Aleph\n\nWritten by Gnostic Instructor\n\n\nWhich in Kabbalah symbolizes Air\n\nAleph, number One. \"God is triune.\" Aleph symbolizes the absolute unity of the three primary forces of God which contain the secret image upon which man must be created.\n\nAleph is formed by two Iods (letter symbol of Kether). One stands on the upper right and the other hangs on the lower left, joined by a diagonal Vav. The two Iods represent the creative power of God in the higher Eden in Daath and the lower Eden in Yesod. The letter Vav between both Iods is man made into the image of the Spirit of God that moves within both Iods (the creative power of God). So, the Spirit of God that moves in the upper waters of Daath and the Spirit of God that moves upon the lower waters of Yesod is the source from which the heavenly man, which is the firmament in between them emerges.\n\nThe upper Eden is first mentioned in the first day of Genesis: \"And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.\u201d These waters are the Akasha Tattva that belongs to upper Eden.\n\nWithin the true magician, the Innermost, the fire of the Holy Spirit (the spirit of God, the Ruach Elohim that hovers upon the face of the waters) within the higher and lower Edens are interchangeable by means of the priesthood of Yesod, Hod and Netzach. This interchange is made when we separate the waters from the waters through initiation, the innermost performs this in the second day of Creation; he separates the two superior ethers from the Akasic waters and creates the second living creature, the consciousness of the man that develops in the firmament or Sephiroth between Daath and Yesod.\n\nThe higher Eden contains the superior Akashic waters of the Holy Spirit, which grants the soul the experiences of Samadhi (to be one with God) while in the lower Eden the inferior Akasic waters of the Holy Spirit are mingled with the fires of desire, here the soul experiences independence or being far from God.\n\nIn Gnosticism, the waters are the symbol of the creative sexual energies. The waters of transmutation have the fire of the Holy Spirit that give us the feeling of being one with God, while the waters of fornication give us the feeling of separation and frustration because we experience the separation from the happiness of God.\n\nThe awakened consciousness is the outcome of both Akashic waters. The greater the concentration on God, the greater the activity of the Akasic waters of Daath, which give us the experience of oneness with His Absolute Being. From the perspective of the lower waters, the greater the transmutation of the Akashic waters of Yesod is, the greater the realization of the reality of God is.\n\nSpiritual elevation can be reached only through in-depth meditation and sexual transmutation.\n\nAleph also symbolizes the solar waters of outer space (Hydrogen), and the lower the oceans and humanity located in the middle.\n\nThe True Man (Vav) is the multiple-perfect-unity, which expresses the Infinite Will of God between earth and heaven.\n\nAleph: the Ain Soph Aur, the Ray of Okidanokh, the Great Breath of the Absolute talks to itself about itself in order to become Aleph, the Wind, the Elohim, the Holy Trinity within the Unity of Life, because \"There is none, other than Iod Hei Vav Hei.\"\n\nThe Ain Soph Aur is the Ray of Okidanokh, the Great Breath of the Absolute. It is the Cosmic Christ that manifests in the World of Atziluth as the Whirling Aleph of Light; it is Kether the Whirlwind of Light that shines in the world of Atziluth.\n\nThe Ain Soph Aur, the Great Breath of the Absolute, is the life that whirls about through Aleph in the center of any atom and every Sun.\n\nThe Life of the Ain Soph throbs in Atziluth within the trinity of Shin, the Fire. It is the vital energy that flows within the profundities of Mem, the Water, and the Light that whirls about within Aleph, the Wind.\n\nThe Ain Soph Aur manifests as life within Fire, Air and Water. Matter cannot exist without the Breath of the Absolute that whirls about within Aleph.\n\nAleph is the Father, Mem is the Mother and Shin is their Son and the Ain Soph Aur throbs within the three of them. They are Iod, Hei Vav Hei.\n\nThe Light of the Ain Soph enters into the world of Atziluth and Whirls about within Aleph, this Light enters into the body within the Air that we breathe through the nose and this Air (oxygen) through the lungs blows the Fire into Mem, the Blood, thereafter, the blood becomes Nun (zoosperm or ovum) within Eve, the sexual organs (Yesod).\n\nThe Tzalem, of the Elohim, throbs within Nun (zoosperm or ovum) which hovers upon the sexual waters, the Semen of Yesod.\n\nTherefore, when seminal energy is transmuted and totally sublimated to the heart, the three nervous systems become saturated with the effluvia of the Light of the Ain Soph. This Light is Christ which illuminates the brain (Adam); it is the Wine of Light at the wedding of Canaan, a miracle of the Christic energy when Adam and Eve become one flesh. This is the secret relationship of the fires of the heart, the breath and the semen.\n\nWe attain dominion over the sexual energy by means of the breath, which must be controlled by our will which is under the powers of the fires of the heart.\n\nTherefore, people who spill the sexual energy (through their bestial orgasm) breathe out the breath of God, thus, they can never receive the blessings of Iod-Havah within their Souls . Their efforts to attain Self-realization, salvation, will undoubtedly fail.\n\nPeople who control their breath can attain sexual control and consequently can also attain control over their mind, soul and spirit. These kinds of people are true human beings who attain immortality.\n\nThose who absorb the Light of the Ain Soph, the Cosmic Christ through the Whirling Aleph of Light, become immortal Divine Christs that can preserve their physical bodies for all of eternity. This is what supreme chastity can grant us when we attain control over the fires of the waters of life by means of the wind, the breath.\n\n\nThe \"Great Wind\" is the Ancient of Days, the root of our Being, the occult of the occult, the mercy of mercies, the goodness of goodness.\n\nThe hair of the Ancient of Days has thirteen ringlets. If we add thirteen among itself we will have 1 + 3 = 4\n\n1 is the masculine principle, fire.\n\n2 is the feminine principle, water.\n\n3 is the Son of creation.\n\n4 is the unity of life.\n\nThis is the holy Tetragrammaton. This is the name of the Eternal One, Iod Hei Vav Hei.\n\nThe hurricane, the four winds, the breath, the Word is represented in the beard of the Ancient of Days. This beard has thirteen locks.\n\nThe four winds are Iod Hei Vav Hei.\n\nThe 13th Arcanum is the Ancient of Days. Only by defeating death can we incarnate the Ancient of Days. The funeral ordeals of the 13th Arcanum are more frightful and terrible than the abyss.\n\nIn order to achieve the realization of the Ancient of Days within ourselves, we must totally accomplish the 13th Arcanum within ourselves.\n\nWe need a supreme death and a supreme resurrection in order to have the right of incarnating the Ancient of Days. Only the one who incarnates him has the right of internally wearing the hair and the beard of a Venerable Elder.\n\nOnly in the presence of the Angels of Death, after becoming victorious in the funeral ordeals, can we incarnate the Ancient of Days. Whosoever incarnates Him becomes another Elder in Eternity.\n\nThe mantra PANDER permits us to reach unto the Ancient of Days. This is possible within profound meditation. In the world of Atziluth there is a marvellous temple where the majestic presence of the Ancient of Days is shown unto us.\n\nThe Ancient of Days dwells in the world of Kether. The chief of that world is the angel Metatron. This angel was the prophet Enoch. With the help of this angel we can enter into the world of Kether. The disciple who wants to penetrate into Kether will beg to the angel Metatron during his states of profound meditation and he will be helped.\n\nThe Aztec goddess of death has a crown with nine human skulls. The crown (Kether) is the symbol of the Ancient of Days.\n\nThe skull (letter Reish) is the microcosmic correspondence of the Ancient of Days in the human being. Indeed, we need a supreme resurrection in order to attain the self-realization of the Ancient of Days within ourselves.\n\nIn the world of Kether we comprehend that the great Law controls all that is created. From the world of the Elder of the Days, we see the human multitudes as leaves hurled by the wind.\n\nThe Great Wind is the terrible law of the Ancient of Days. \"Vox Populi Vox Dei\". A social revolt contemplated from the world of the Ancient of Days is a law in action. Each person, the entire multitudes look like leaves detached from the trees, hurled by the terrific wind of the Ancient of Days.\n\nPeople do not know about these things. People are only preoccupied by acquiring money and more money. This is the poor, suffering humanity, who are only miserable leaves hurled by the great wind, miserable leaves hurled by the great Law.\n\nOur authentic Being, in his essential root, is the Ancient of Days. He is the Father in us. He is our true Being. Our disciples must now concentrate and meditate very deeply on the Ancient of Days. The ecstasy, Samadhi, must be induced during meditation.\n\nMay peace reign in all hearts; let us not forget that peace is light. Let us not forget that peace is an Essence emanated from the Absolute. It is light emanated from the Absolute. This light is the light of the Ancient of Days. Christ said, \"Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you.\" (John: 14: 27). - Tarot and Kabbalah by Samael Aun Weor\n\n\nI am in the Father and the Father is in me!\n\nJohn 14: 11-31:\n\nBelieve me that I (the effluvia of the fires of the Nous Atom in the heart) am in the Father (in the Cerebrospinal Nervous System) and the (wind, oxygen, that is the will of the) Father (that enters in the bloodstream is) in me; or else believe me for the sake of the works (within the bloodstream) themselves.\n\n\"Verily, verily, I say to you, (the Three Nervous Systems of) he who believes in me (the effluvia of the fires of the Nous Atom in the heart) will also do the works that I do (through the bloodstream); and greater works than these will he do, because (by means of White Tantra) I go (as Solar Fire) to the Father (throughout the Sushumna Canal).\n\nWhatever you ask (with your heart) in my (fiery) name, I will do it (through the Sushumna Canal), that the Father (the Innermost) may be glorified (in Hod) in the Son (the Astral Body); if you ask anything (during Sacred Transmutation) in my (fiery) name, I will do it. \"If you love me (the Ain Soph Aur), you will keep my (22) commandments (with Tiphereth your Human Soul). And I (in the stone of Jacob, Yesod) will pray the Father (through the ladder to heaven, the spinal medulla, the Cerebrospinal Nervous System) and he will give you another Counselor (in the spinal medulla), to be with you for ever, even the (Holy) Spirit of truth (Nachash, the Kundalini ) , whom the world cannot receive, because (of fornication) it neither sees him nor knows him; you know him, for he (through White Tantra) dwells with you (in the stone of Jacob, Yesod), and will be in you (when it rises the Sushumna Canal).\n\n\"I (the effluvia of the fires of the Nous Atom in the heart) will not leave you desolate; I will come to you (by means of White Tantra) .\n\nYet a little while, and the world (of the senses) will see me no more, but you will see me (with the eyes \u201cAyin\u201d of the Spirit); because I live (within Ruach, the Essence of God, Kether), you will live also (by means of death). In that day (when Nachash, the Kundalini awakens and reaches between the eyebrows) you will know that I (the effluvia of the fires of the Nous Atom in the heart) am in my Father (the Wind, the Ruach, the Innermost hovering in the waters of Yesod), and you in me, and I in you (through the fire of Chastity) . Whosoever has (comprehended) my (22) commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves me (through the effluvia of the fires of the Nous Atom in the heart); and he who loves me will be loved by my Father (the Wind, the Ruach, the Innermost hovering in the waters of Yesod), and I will love him and manifest myself to him (through the Venustic Initiation).\" Judas Thaddeus (the power of the sacrum, where the fire of the Holy Ghost abides, precisely in the Church of Ephesus) said to him, \"Lord, how is it that you will manifest yourself to us (as Fire in the Triveni, in the sacrum, in the Chakra Muladhara or Church of Ephesus, close to the coccyx), and not to the world (of the senses)?\"\n\nJesus answered him, \"If a man loves me (by means of the mysteries of Daath, White Tantra) , he will keep my word (or FIAT, the Ruach that is my Tzalem that hovers upon the Raw Mercury of the Great Work), and my Father (the Glorian) will (pour his) love (in) him, and we will come (from the Sacrum all the way up to the brain) to him and make our home with him (in the heart). Whosoever does not love me (the fornicator) does not keep my words (Logoi); and the word (Logos) which you hear is not mine but the Father's who sent me (the First Logos).\n\n\"These things I have spoken to you, while I am still with you (as fire of Love in the left ventricle of your heart). But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name (in the shape of the Serpent of Bronze, Nachash), he will teach you all things (through fire), and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you.\n\nPeace (the substance of Kether, the Father of all Lights) I leave with you; my peace I give to you; not as the world (of the senses) gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid (since I dwell as fire in left ventricle of their hearts). You heard me say to you (through the initiation) I go away, and I will come to you (totally transformed). If you loved me, you would have rejoiced, because I (as fire) go to the Father (through the Sushumna Canal); for the Father (the Wind, Kether, the Ancient of Days) is greater than I (the Nous Atom).\n\nAnd now I have told you before it take place, so that when it does take place, you may believe (in the metamorphosis of the fire). I will no longer talk much with you, for the ruler of this world (the intellect of Fornicators) is coming. He has no power over me (the Nous or Superior Mind); but I do (by means of the Grand Sympathetic Nervous System) as the Father (the Innermost) has commanded me, so that the world may know that I (the Nous Atom through the bloodstream) love (perform the will of) the Father. Rise (your Nachash, the Sacrum Spirit, as Moses did in the wilderness), let us go hence (within the Sushumna Canal to the Father of all Lights).\n\n\nThe term \u2018Arcana\u2019 is plural. The singular aspect of this term is \u2018Arcanum.\u2019 \u2018Arcanum\u2019 refers to a type of knowledge, which is for the initiated, or a kind of knowledge that is mysterious for the average person. It is a science or understanding that one has to be introduced to. When we study the twenty-two Arcana, we are studying twenty-two laws, or twenty-two mysteries, that we have to be initiated into experientially in order to understand them.\n\nThe twenty-two Arcana of the Kabbalah are twenty-two laws. We know in the Judeo-Christian tradition that we he have ten primary laws, or Ten Commandments, that are discussed very commonly. But there are twelve more. These twenty-two laws, or twenty-two Arcana, contain the entire process of religion, or in other words religare, which is Latin for \u201cunion.\u201d\n\nThe twenty-two Arcana are steps, or clues, which illuminate religion itself, or this process of union. In the Judeo-Christian tradition, and of course in the Gnostic tradition, these twenty-two laws have been symbolized in various ways. We have already mentioned the Ten Commandments, which are the first and most obvious representation of these twenty-two steps. But there is another less commonly recognized aspect, or symbol, of these twenty-two Arcana: the Book of the Tarot.\n\nThe Tarot cards, or the images of the Tarot, form a book of twenty-two images. These twenty-two images symbolize and represent twenty-two Arcana, steps, laws, mysteries, which the initiate needs to understand and know in order to understand and know the Path to self-realization of the Being.\nThese twenty-two Arcana are also symbolized and represented in the twenty-two characters of the Hebrew alphabet. Each character of this alphabet symbolizes and represents different laws and aspects of the Path to the self-realization of the Being.\n\nSo for us who aspire to comprehend and understand that Path, to enter that Path, to make it manifest in us, it is vital that we understand the nature of these twenty-two laws. Within them is the Path itself. More than that, the foundation upon which we work in Gnosis is direct experience. The term \u2018 Gnosis\u2019 itself indicates that. Gnosis is not a mere belief or a theory; it is a science of direct experiences, or a scientific method which leads to one\u2019s own direct experience of the Truth. The Truth itself is the twenty-two Arcana, so to experience directly the nature of Truth, we study these twenty-two Arcana in order to help us organize our own experiences, to understand them.\n\nWhen we study the Judeo-Christian tradition, and we look into the book of Genesis, we see that there is a great symbol at the very beginning of the book, in the first few chapters. We find two trees in the Garden of Eden. The first tree is the Tree of Life. This is a symbol of the Kabbalah, or the science of numbers, which we will begin to analyze today.\n\n\nThe Kabbalah is a map of our own consciousness. It is also a map of the universe. The universe and our consciousness are reflections of one another, and the Kabbalah encodes that, it symbolizes that. So the Tree of Life in the Bible is a symbol of this science of numbers. And of course, as anyone who studies the Bible knows, numbers play a huge role throughout the Bible. There are always seven of this and three of that\u2014we see in all religions that numbers have a huge importance; this evidence of the universal presence of Kabbalah, even if it is not called by that name. The twenty-two Arcana introduce us to the science of understanding the symbols of those numbers in order to help illuminate our own path.\n\nThe second tree is the Tree of Knowledge, the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Bad, or Good and Evil. This tree is the source of the forbidden fruit. In the Bible, it is clearly stated that we should not eat of the forbidden fruit. In order to understand what that means, we need to know what the Tree of Knowledge is; it is symbolic of something within us. The term \u2018knowledge,\u2019 of course, is the word \u2018 Gnosis. \u2019 Gnosis itself is the root of the term knowledge. But in Hebrew, it is the term Daath.\n\n\nThe Tree of Life, which is the first tree that I described, is the Kabbalah, is symbolized in its most common representation as ten spheres. These ten spheres are organized as a structure of three columns on which hang three triangles. So already we see numbers. The Kabbalah, these ten spheres, or Sephiroth, represent levels of consciousness, aspects of our own inner psychology.\n\nThe Tree of Knowledge, or Daath, is one more sphere, which is hidden within the Tree of Life. These two trees are said to share the same roots; they are closely interrelated.\n\n\nWhen we study Gnosis, or study any religion, it is important for us to understand we have to study both of these trees together. The Tree of Life is the study of our own consciousness, the study of our own psyche, the study of our own Inner Being. And the Tree of Knowledge is the science of Alchemy; it is the secret wisdom, or secret knowledge, which illuminates the Tree of Life.\n\nThe sphere of Daath, or the Tree of Knowledge, has always been hidden, has always been esoteric; it is something that one must be \u201cinitiated\u201d into (or introduced into). Daath is the Great Arcanum, it is the Truth of truths, the Secret of secrets. It is what has always been veiled in the Temple. It is the Ark of Noah, and the Ark of the Covenant\u2014the great ARC-anum. The Twenty-two Arcana are mere elaborations of the one Great Arcanum.\n\nIn the course of these twenty-two lectures, we will be examining these two trees continually, comparing them, understanding them, side by side. This is Kabbalah and Alchemy. These are the two columns of the great hierarchies of God: Wisdom and Love. Daath, this secret knowledge, or esoteric knowledge, related to alchemy, is wisdom; and the Tree of Life, the Kabbalah, is love: the two columns which form the foundation of the Temple, or the support of the Temple.\n\nThat temple, of course, is our own soul , the Temple of our own Living God. To construct and perfect our own inner temple is the purpose of religion, or religare (Latin for reunion). And the construction of our own inner temple is supported by and made strong by the study of these two trees together.\n\nThe Tree of Life in ourselves must become fully illuminated\u2014that is Self-realization. But the illumination, the light, is provided by the Tree of Knowledge. So these two trees, these two columns, are in themselves the science to self-realize the Being.\n\nThe twenty-two Arcana, as I stated, are esoteric, or hidden laws. They are symbols. So in the beginning we always begin with the number one. Today\u2019s lecture is about Arcanum one, which is the Magician.\n\ntarot 1\n\nWhen you observe the first card of the Tarot, you see the Magician. But who is the Magician? We have to understand that. This card is symbolic and imparts to us a vital understanding upon which the basis of the entire set of Arcana rests.\n\nThe number one is the number which begins; unity. It is initiative, the beginning. But the number one emerges from nothing. Really, the number one comes from the zero.\n\nWhen we study the Kabbalah, and look at our map, we see that the Tree of Life unfolds from the Absolute, or from the womb of the Divine Mother. That Womb is the Zero. It is Primordial Potentiality.\n\nZero is a profound and ancient symbol. It is potentiality, creation, the ocean from which life emerges. The womb of the Divine Mother gives birth to One. So if we see a one and a zero, we see the beginning, the start. We also see the number ten \u2013 one and a zero. We also see \u2018IO,\u2019 which is the core component of the name of the Divine Mother.\n\nThe one in this case is the projective force, the masculine principle, which initiates, which begins. And the one on the Tree of Life, in this context, is representing Kether, or the first Sephira. That one, in its emerging from the womb, is truthfully the first Trinity, or Three in One, which is Kether, Chokmah, and Binah. The Three in One is the Cosmic Christ, the radiant force which illuminates all of life. He is one, but He is three, and He emerges from the zero, from nothing.\n\n\nThis manifestation we call Iod-Hevah, or in other words, the Tetragrammaton \u2013 four letters in Hebrew, which represent the Father-Mother with the characters Iod He Vau He. These four letters contain a vast amount of symbolism, but the emphasis that I want to place at this moment is a relationship that exists between the zero, the one, and the Iod, the first character of this Tetragrammaton.\n\n\nIod, as a letter of the Hebrew alphabet, is actually the tenth letter. So you see we have the number ten here\u2014the one and the zero, the womb and the Father, the Mother and the Father. The Iod is the tenth character. The Iod in itself represents the man, masculine, the phallus, the creative force. It is indicating the number one in a very strong way. And if you Kabbalistically take the number of Iod, which is ten, and you reduce it with Kabbalistic numerology, it is a one, because one plus zero is one.\n\nThe Iod is the impulse, the masculine force which initiates, which drives, which pushes.\n\nWhen this Three in One, the Trinity, the Cosmic Christ, unfolds itself in order to create, it divides itself. It does so in it\u2019s third aspect: the sephirah Binah.\n\n\nWithin the sphere of Binah, we find the Holy Spirit, or this creative impulse, this fire, which wants to give rise to manifestation. Binah divides itself into male-female, into Abba-Aima, Shiva-Shakti, the masculine-feminine manifestation of the One. This is Iod-He-Vau-He, this is Iod-Hevah, Adam-Eve, the primordial couple, Shiva-Shakti of the Hindus, Osiris-Isis of the Egyptians, Abba-Aima of Judaism, the Yab-yum of Tantrism. Shiva-Shakti (Osiris-Isis), in their union, form Daath, the Tree of Knowledge.\n\nShiva, or Osiris, is the masculine manifestation of this first Trinity who is One. Shiva is the Three in One Himself, but polarized masculine.\n\nShakti, his wife, is the feminine polarization of the Three in One.\n\nThese two polarizations, male and female, unify themselves; they join once again in order to create, and this is Daath, this is the Tree of Knowledge.\n\n\nThe creation that Daath unfolds (or in other words, that Shiva and Shakti unfold) is their son. Their son is called Horus in the Egyptian pantheon. Osiris and Isis join and produce a son, who is Horus in Egyptian symbolism. This son is Chesed on the Tree of Life, the fourth Sephira.\n\nChesed is the Magician. Arcanum One is Chesed. Chesed is called Atman in the Eastern traditions. He is our own, individual, personal Father. He has his own Father, who is Kether. So you can see that this Arcanum One, which is singular, which is one, which initiates, has depths, has levels, because our own intimate, inner Father has his Father. Our own Being has his Being.\n\nThe Being of our Being is, of course, the Cosmic Christ. The Being of our Being is Kether, but Kether is Three in One. Our Intimate, our Innermost, Chesed, is manifested in order to perform a certain duty, in order to become a perfect magician. Now it is necessary for us to understand what is a magician, what is magic.\n\nThe term \u2018magician\u2019 has been grossly degenerated in our modern time. It actually comes from a very ancient root. When I pointed out this term \u2018Atman,\u2019 this has a relationship with the term \u2018magician,\u2019 with its roots. You\u2019ve probably heard of a Mahatma: this is a compound word. It is Maha-atman. Atman, of course, is our own Inner Father, our own Inner Spirit. \u2018Maha\u2019 means \u2018great\u2019 in Sanskrit: Maha-atman\u2014great spirit, great soul .\n\nIn Sanskrit, an H can also be a G: so maha can also be read as maga, mage, magi. A magi is a priest. We know the three magi from the stories of the Bible, the New Testament, which were three kings, or three priests, who came from the east to worship the Christ. But the term magi, or mage, actually comes from ancient Sanskrit and an Assyrian, Babylonian, and Persian term, from \u2018mag\u2019 or \u2018maha,\u2019 and the magi were worshipers of the sun, priests. The sun, of course we know, is a symbol of the Christ. So the real magician is a priest. And working with magic, real magic, is actually a sacred priesthood, a sacred office. Most importantly, the real magician is not the terrestrial person. The one who really works with magic is our own Inner Father, our inner maha-atman.\n\nWhen we look at the symbol of the card, the image of the magician, we are looking at a symbol of our own Inner Being, our own Inner Father. We see the magician with a serpent on his forehead. The serpent is a symbol of mastery, a symbol of illumination. He carries in his hand a staff, or a rod, which symbolizes power, and that rod, that vertical column is the spinal column. He has one hand up and one hand down. The one hand up is raising the rod, pointing to heaven. The hand down is pointing to the waters beneath his feet, which is an instruction to his son, to his child, which we\u2019ll come to. But the form of his figure, one up, one down, and his body between, forms the character Aleph, which is the first character of the Hebrew alphabet.\n\n\nAleph, of course, is number one. It is that first character which initiates, which begins. He is, in himself, that character Aleph. The Being is the Aleph, the Alpha, the first. As far as we are concerned, He is our number one. We are in suffering because we have forgotten Him. We are in pain because we neglect our duty to Him. When our Being becomes once again our number one, first, and we perform our duty in accordance with his directive, we achieve religion, religare.\n\nBefore the magician is a table. The table has four sides, it forms a cubic shape. The four here represents a number of things. It represents the four elements that the magician has to command. Anyone who has studied anything of what we call magic knows that the magician works with the elements of nature: fire, water, air, and earth. And the great magician is the one who commands those elements in order to perform his will. Moses, for example, was a great magician. Jesus was a great magician. These were initiates who developed the capacity to command the elements of nature, to calm storms, to raise tempests, to rattle the earth, to have power of the forces of life and death. The terrestrial person is not the one who can do those things, it is the Inner Being, God. But God, that Father, works through the initiate, works through His son, His child.\n\nThe four sides of the table also represent the vehicles through which the Being works. So returning to the Tree of Life, we see the sphere of Chesed, who is one part of a trinity with three spheres, Chesed being the first, or highest part. Next to that is Buddhi, Geburah, which is our Divine Soul, Divine Consciousness, which is a feminine aspect of the Being. And next to her is Tiphereth, or Manas, which is a masculine aspect of the Being. So our Innermost, our Atman, our Chesed, has two souls , one masculine and one feminine. But these three are one. The Magician perfected is these three aspects perfectly unified. The number one is unity. That is the goal of the Magician\u2014unity. But that unity is in the soul .\n\n\nBelow this trinity of the Monad, we have the four vehicles that the Monad will work through. The first, in descending order, is Netzach, or the mind, the mental body. The next is Hod, emotion, or the emotional body. The third is Yesod, the energetic body, the vital body, the etheric body. And last is Malkuth, the physical body. These are the four bodies of sin\u2014the four bodies with which we either create problems or create the soul . These four bodies are the laboratory of the Magician. The Magician works with these four aspects of Himself in order to command the elements and reach perfection.\n\n\nFor the Magician to accomplish this goal, for our Inner Being to fulfill His own duty, He needs these four vehicles to be perfected, to be perfect vehicles for His purposes. In other words, the terrestrial person has to work. We, of course, inhabit our physical body. The physical body that we have is made possible, and is alive, because of the Being, because of our own Inner God. We have this physical body because He gave it to us to serve Him.\n\nThe body is able to live, digest, function, perceive, and act because of these other vehicles which reside within it. The etheric, or vital, body is the basis of our digestion, all chemical processes, all of the energetic processes. Everything that occurs inside of us that gives us life is based upon the vital body, Yesod. That is one reason why Yesod, or the Ninth Sphere, is called \u2018The Foundation.\u2019 It is the foundation of life.\n\nWe also have the astral body, which is related to our emotions, and this is the body we use when we dream. When we have a dream, when we fall asleep physically, we begin dreaming, we are actually traveling in our astral body. The physical body rests, the vital body gathers energy in order to restore the physical body, and the rest of us escapes and begins to wander within our own mind. But that wandering is occurring with a vehicle, a vessel. That is the astral body.\n\nWe also have the mental body, related to our intellect, or mind, the process of cognition, thought, reasoning. These four parts are the four wheels of the chariot, the four horses of the chariot, the four aspects of the soul that the Magician needs to command.\n\nBut what is commanding our intellect now? What is it that is driving our emotional well-being now? Who is in control of our emotions? Who is in control of our thoughts? Who is in control of our actions? Why is it that when we do something wrong, we always say, \u201cOh, that wasn\u2019t me\u201d? When we lie, when we steal, when we cheat, and we get caught, we say, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know why I did that. That just wasn\u2019t me. I\u2019m not like that. I\u2019m not that kind of person.\u201d Then who did it? Who is it that is bringing up all the thoughts and feelings that we are having now? The last time we got really angry, who was in charge of that anger? Who was driving and bringing that anger? Was it your Being? Of course not. This is where the work begins. Anger is related to the element fire: if we cannot dominate our own anger, then we cannot dominate the element fire. We need to be Kings and Queens of nature, controlling all the elements in ourselves.\n\nWe, as an essence, as a consciousness, as the son of that Father, as the child of that Father, have to gain control over ourselves. Our consciousness is a portion of the Being. It is a spark, it is an embryo, that He can work through, but we have to control it. We are a spark of this Monad, called the \u201cessence.\u201d The spark is that little bit of conscious will that we have. Sometimes we call it conscience. It is that part of us that knows what is right and what is wrong\u2014just knows it, does not reason, does not rationalize, does not need anyone to tell it, \u201cYes, this is right; no, this is wrong.\u201d We just know. That is part of the Being. The Being speaks through that voice of the conscience.\n\nOur job, in order to comprehend and enter into the science of the twenty-two Arcana, is to make that conscience strong. It is made strong by listening to it; by doing what is right; by stopping wrong actions, wrong thoughts, wrong feelings. This is an effort of will.\n\nIn the Kabbalah, in the Tree of Life, we look at the trinity of the Monad, we see this sphere Tiphereth, which I mentioned is Manas, the human soul. Really, Tiphereth is the center of will for us. Tiphereth is the knight, the warrior, who fights on behalf of the Magician-King.\n\nThe Master Jesus said, \u201cYe must be perfect as your Father in heaven is perfect.\u201d We are not perfect. Many people nowadays believe that this was a symbolic thing that He said, that we become perfect by believing in Him. But it is not said that way. It is said very clearly, \u201cYe must be perfect.\u201d This is a very direct statement, and part of a talk in which He is discussing, anyone who has adultery cannot enter heaven; anyone who criticizes, who kills with their words, cannot enter heaven; murderers, fornicators, adulterers, cannot. The reason is heaven is, in levels, the realm of perfection, of perfected beings. How can we, who are imperfect, enter there? We cannot. We enter there by becoming like them, perfected in ourselves, which is a work of will.\n\nThe Innermost, the Magician, needs to dominate nature, to control nature, to be a king, to be a priest, who dominates the elements. But in order for Him to do that, he has to arrange the elements on the table in front of Him. The sword is a symbol of will. The sword is the weapon that the initiate must use in order to conquer himself. The vase, the jar, the chalice, has two aspects. It symbolizes the mind, which must be cleansed. It also symbolizes the feminine sexual organ, the yoni. In like manner, the sword represents the masculine sexual organ. And third on the table is a moon. The moon has to be converted into a sun. What this means is that our lunar psychology, lunar being mechanical and belonging to nature, belonging to the realm of the animal, has to be converted into solar, being part of the kingdom of the sun, Christic. The moon in us, the lunar forces, have to be conquered and transformed into solar forces. These are the works that are performed on the table. All of this is empowered, and made possible, by the Holy Spirit, who is symbolized in the card by a bird under the table.\n\nNow all of this work is occurring on top of the waters, the lowest aspect of the card. And inside the waters, we see a perfect stone, a perfect cube. This is pointing to masonry, and the work of the mason is to perfect the stone. The stone resides in the water; it is the Sophic Hydrolith, the Water Stone of Wisdom.\n\nWhat is a stone and a liquid? What is both stone and liquid? Mercury. Mercury is the symbol of alchemy which indicates the sexual energy. The stone that we have to perfect is our own sexual matter, it is the foundation stone of the temple. Those columns of the Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge are founded upon this stone, the foundation stone, which the whole temple is built upon. The foundation stone is here in the waters, the lowest part of this card. This corresponds to the Ninth Sphere, Yesod, which is of courses related to our vital, etheric body.\n\nIf we place the Tree of Life as a diagram over our physical body, Yesod points to and indicates the sexual organs. Yesod, the Ninth Sphere, is the root of the Tree of Knowledge. It is where we work with the science of alchemy, learning how to transmute our sexual matter, to transform our animal, instinctive sexual forces, lunar forces into solar, perfected, divine, and heavenly sexual forces.\n\n\nSex is natural to the human being\u2014part of the creation of God\u2014but sex performed under divine will, under the auspices of the Magician, who needs to manage those forces in order to realize Himself. The Magician, then, standing in the form of the Aleph, this Hebrew character, is that force which initiates. He has the prayer to become that perfect Aleph.\n\nWhen we analyze this character of Aleph, and we disarrange its parts in order to understand it, we see it is actually made of three primary aspects. And of course, when we see that it has three aspects, we are reminded immediately of the Trinity, three in one, the Trinity which is the basis of the Being. These three aspects are in fact two Iod\u2019s and a Vau, Hebrew characters.\n\n\nThe Iod is the masculine, projective, creative principle.\n\n\nThe Vau is the sixth letter of the Hebrew alphabet. When we count the spheres, we see that the sixth sphere is Tiphereth, the human soul.\n\nThe Magician has to work with the two Iod\u2019s and the Vau in order to form the perfect Aleph. When we understand that, then we can see how He does it. The first Iod, we understood, to be in Daath, that hidden sphere between Binah and Chesed. That first Iod is the upper Eden. It is Daath, but related to the Being. It is the potential for the Being to create and manifest. This is that first Iod, the upper Eden. The second Iod is in the lower Eden, in Yesod, in our own sexual waters. So we see that the Iod, this masculine, projective force, is the fire, or the potentiality, which exists within the waters.\n\n\nIn the Book of Genesis we read that the Spirit of God moved on the face of the waters. These waters represent the upper Eden, in Daath. These are the waters of Genesis from which creation emerges as an act of magic. This magical creation in Daath is a creation that our own Being performs in order to begin His manifestation. The Inner Christ, manifest as Shiva-Shakti, works in these waters of Genesis. This is that first Iod, the Iod of Iod-He-Vau-He. The creation that emerges from that is Vau. Vau, we know is related to the human soul. That Vau is the spinal column, the human soul. And the last, or the second, Iod, is in Yesod, in the waters of sexuality.\n\nSo the Magician, the Innermost, has to work with the will of his human soul to bring together the two Iod\u2019s, the lower Eden and upper Eden, in order to reach perfection. The combination of those elements produces the Aleph, which is the perfect Magician, and this is all an act of will. This can only be done when we as the terrestrial person cooperate. We have to work with the waters of Genesis; we have to work with the two trees; we have to transmute the waters of the lower Eden; we have to comprehend the waters of the upper Eden.\n\nThe Magician performs his ritual, his priestly duty, by managing the forces arranged on the table, these four elements. He performs his magic, or his works, upon this altar. And these works are Hermetic Magic, which are works related to the mind in Netzach; He performs his works of Natural Magic, or ritualistic magic in the sphere of Hod, related to the astral plane, or the emotional body; and to unify them and empower them, He works with the process of Sexual Magic in Yesod. You can say in other terms the Hermetic Priesthood, the Natural Priesthood, and the Sexual Priesthood. These are sacred duties\u2014sacred duties that the terrestrial person performs on behalf of the Intimate, the Innermost, empowered by the Innermost, for the benefit of the Innermost.\n\nWhat this means for us, we have to begin to enforce will, to develop our own willpower, to have the capacity to command our own inner nature. And this begins right now. This is not some theoretical or extremely complicated numerical idea. In order for your own Being, your own inner Magician, to arrange the items on the table and to achieve religion, He has to have a vehicle through which He can work.\n\nIf our own will is trapped in our pride, is trapped in our anger, is trapped in our lust, the connection to our Innermost is lost. It is not present. When we remain a slave of our envy, we are not serving the Being. The Gospels state very clearly you cannot serve two masters. We have to analyze ourselves. With each action that we perform, we need to analyze. On whose behalf am I doing this? On whose behalf am I acting? When we feel the impulse to speak to another person, do we consider why we must speak? On whose behalf? Is it because we are angry and we want to express our anger? Is it because our feelings are hurt and we want revenge? We have to question and analyze our every activity in every moment. This is a work of will, conscious will, exercised over our three brains: our intellect, our emotion, and our motor-instinctive and sexual aspect.\n\nThis work of will is a work of attention. In synthesis you can say the work of the twenty-two Arcana is a work to perfect attention, to perfect consciousness, to perfect conscience. The work of the Magician is to perfect Himself. But He can\u2019t do that if we remain enslaved, enslaved by our own pride, our own self-justifications, our attachments, our desires.\n\nThe Innermost, to become that perfect Aleph, to become that Maha-Atman, that perfect Magician, needs us. Some say that this sounds strange, that God needs us, but it is true. We are a part of Him. We do not exist here just by chance, or just for entertainment. We exist to fulfill a specific role, a defined duty, towards our own Innermost, our own Inner Father. And He in turn has His duty. For Him to perform His work, we have to do ours, and ours is to become His will. That is why in the Lord\u2019s Prayer, we see Jesus gives us this great example, great prayer of tremendous power, \u201cThy will be done.\u201d \u201cThy\u201d\u2014my Inner Father. May the will of my Inner Being be done on earth (in me in my physical body) as it is in heaven.\n\nThat is a process of conquering all of the wills that we have inside which are opposed to the will of the Innermost. My lust does not want what my being wants. My pride wants to be noticed, wants to be admired, or envied. My Being does not want that.\n\nSo in moment to moment analysis of ourselves, we conquer and comprehend each discursive will that we have inside. Every ego that we have, every psychological aggregate, has its own will, and all of these different wills are not the will of the Innermost. To know the will of the Innermost, we have to separate ourselves from the ego.\n\nWhen we look back at this card of the First Arcanum, we see in the superior portion a pair of eyes, always watching, always looking. These are the eyes of the Father. Every action we perform, every thought we think, every feeling that we entertain, is not just ours to observe. Our Being is inside of us. Your own Inner Father is the root of your existence. He knows every atom that you inhabit. So obviously He knows your thoughts and feelings as well.\n\nHow is it that we can allow negative thoughts and negative emotions to flourish in our mind? How is it that we can allow them to continue to express themselves, with their resentment, their criticism, their desires, their accounts against other people. \u201cSo and so did this to me. So and so did that to me. I didn\u2019t deserve that.\u201d We allow all of that to persist in our interior, and from time to time we take a little break from our inner song to pray. Somehow we think that the moment we stop to pray, then God is there. God is only there when we pray to Him, is what we think. So we are going all day long imagining scenes of lust, imagining scenes of getting vengeance against our enemies, real or otherwise, and then we take a little break and say, \u201cOh, God, I remember you.\u201d And we think somehow that that is the only thing He sees, somehow that moment of prayer.\n\nWell I\u2019m sorry to point out to you, as painful as it might sound, that He is there all the time, so those twenty-three hours and fifty-nine minutes that you were lost in fantasies about the past and future, dreaming about making money, or dreaming about becoming famous, your Being is there too. These eyes are always watching inside of you.\n\nWill needs to be there all the time in us, the will to change; the will to fight against our own, stubborn, animal nature. Never forget the presence of your Being inside. If you maintain the continuity of the awareness and remembrance of your own Inner God, you are establishing Self-Remembering, the remembrance of the Inner Self, the remembrance of the Being. This is to treat every moment as a moment spent inside of a temple, to feel within yourself that in each instant, you are in the presence of the most unimaginable divinity. And when you are confronted with the impulses of your own lust, your own fear, your own hate, recall and remember the presence of your own Inner God, and exercise the will of your consciousness to remember Him, and to observe yourself through His eyes, as He sees you.\n\nThat effort is the foundation of the entrance into the direct understanding of the twenty-two Arcana. These eyes are always watching, always present, always observing, and you see in their shape, the symbol of infinity, the symbol of the infinite. That infinite, of course, is the Being of the Being. When we look at the way nature unfolds on the Tree of Life, we see that this first triangle of Kether, Chokmah, and Binah is related to the infinite, that is the Being of the Being, the infinite manifestation which comes out of the unmanifest.\n\nWhen the Being is working, when our own Innermost is working, to unify Himself as Aleph, to work in the waters of the upper Eden, which are the Akashic energies, the Akashic Tattwa, and working the lower Eden, in the waters of Genesis, of transmutation of sexual matter, the Innermost is doing that as a work of will as His son or daughter, the human soul, is entering into initiation. The process of initiation, as a soul , is a process of working with these waters, working with the psyche, and working with laws.\n\nIn this process, the initiate is trying to work with these two waters directly. In relation to the upper, the initiate has to meditate in order to comprehend the Akashic Tattwa, the higher aspects of energy related to the Being. Meditation is how we become closer to God. By concentrating on God, by remembering God, by focusing on our Inner Being, we are working with forces to bring us closer to Him. If we forget Him, we will not become closer to Him. But the more we remain in Self-remembering, the more we meditate to comprehend the nature of the Being, the more we are working directly with the waters of the upper Eden to penetrate and comprehend Him, to understand Him who is inside.\n\nAt the same time, we have to work with the waters of transmutation through the magic of Yesod. And in this way by transmuting our sexual forces, we are gathering the energies and forces of the Holy Spirit, which brings us closer to God. When we reject that, when we fornicate, when we abuse our sexual forces, we become further and further from God, more and more emptiness in our hearts, more and more loneliness, more of a spiritual vacuum, this void, painful void that we feel in the heart when God does not fill us.\n\nTo become closer to God, then, we work in these two ways: transmutation and meditation. This creates a dynamic exchange, the center of which is the human soul, as a work of will. That human soul is the Vau, that character Vau which symbolizes the spinal column upon which those fires of Yesod must rise. That constant flow and exchange of energy produces a current fueled by meditation and transmutation, and that current is what draws together the two Iod\u2019s to the Vau to create the perfect magician.\n\nThe waters of the upper and lower Edens merge in the perfected Vau, or the human soul. And that Aleph, or the Innermost, as the transformer of that energy, moves. The Aleph spins.\n\n\nThat spin is produced by will\u2014will over desire, will over nature, will over the four elements. That is the work to arrange the elements on the table; that is the work to create the perfect Aleph.\n\nAny questions?\n\nAudience: The books say that ego and Being cannot coexist, yet you stress that the Being is always present. How is that possible?\n\nBecause you still have an essence, you still have a consciousness. Your Being is in you, because you still have a connection with Him. But He\u2019s only in you to a certain point, a very small percentage relative to the amount of consciousness that you have free of ego.\n\nIf you became completely absorbed in your ego, one hundred percent, your Being becomes divorced from you and you fall from the Tree of Life like a leaf falling off of a tree. And then the Being is not there. You just become dead matter\u2014a leaf tossed by the winds of Karma to be recycled by nature.\n\nSo long as you maintain some percentage of free consciousness inside, you maintain the connection to your Being. The more consciousness you free, through performing the Work, the stronger your connection to your Being becomes. And of course, the Work in the end is to eliminate all the ego, so the Being can completely inhabit you and incarnate in you. But it is a process of steps to reach that.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\nThink about that.\n\nAudience: Say you wake up more percentage of the consciousness, but you still have that much more ego. You said the Being is always present in your lust, in your anger\u2014He\u2019s always present.\n\nOkay. It is true that the Being is present even when your ego is there, and the reason is because your consciousness is trapped inside of that ego. Your consciousness belongs to the Being.\n\nYour Being is the animating fire in every cell of your body. Your Being is the animating fire of everything that you are. He is also in your ego, but as Lucifer. So He knows you inside and out.\n\nAudience: Can you explain why the Sephiroth work in three\u2019s?\n\nThe Law of Three is one of the fundamental laws that nature is based upon. The Trinity is a form of balance. You have a first force which initiates, which begins. You can also call them notes. This would be the note \u2018Do,\u2019 the note that begins something.\n\nBut any time you have a projective force, you immediately imply a receptive force, you have projective and receptive. So then you have two forces that are opposing one another. In order to create balance, you have a third, which creates harmony. So that is just a fundamental structure which you find everywhere in nature. And that is one of the things that indicates and shows the intelligence that resides in all matter, in all phenomena.\n\nSo when we study Kabbalah, we are just putting in a symbolic form something that you can directly perceive in almost any aspect of nature that you look at. Make sense?\n\nAudience: Something is missing.\n\nYeah. It is a symbol of how things work in nature.\n\nAudience: In terms of the three dimensions\u2026\n\nNo, it is not so much related to that. That is a different point of view. The Trinity in this sense is the law of creation, how things are created. So when we look at groups of threes, we are looking at how certain forces working in harmony create.\n\nWhen you talk about dimensions, this is another thing. So there are dimensions within dimensions, but within those, the Law of Three is functioning.\n\nAudience: Is it dangerous to practice transmutation without meditation?\n\nThe question is very interesting. One can practice transmutation and not meditate and certain results will occur. To transmute means to harness a force and change it. \u2018Trans\u2013\u2019 is the basic prefix there, which indicates \u2018from one thing to another.\u2019 And \u2018mutate\u2019 means \u2018change\u2019\u2014to transmute.\n\nBut, firstly we have to grasp who performs the transmutation. Who is it that is the Magician that changes lead into gold? Who is that alchemist? It is the Being, the Innermost.\n\nThe one who performs magic is the Inner Being. The one who transmutes the energy is the Inner Being. The one who performs the ritual, or empowers the mantra, is the Inner Being. We as a terrestrial person are just a vessel, a vehicle.\n\nWe can perform the exercise of a ritual and it will have no effect. We can perform the exercise of transmutation and it will have no effect if the Being is not there, if the will of the Being is not within it.\n\nTo know the will of the Being requires that you speak His language. The language of the Being is symbolic, and it is very sophisticated. That language is the Kabbalah; that language is numbers; that language is in the images of the Tarot and many other symbolic forms that the Being will speak through.\n\nIf we perform an exercise of transmutation, that is good, because this is what the Being needs. But the fruit of that exercise is given out by the Being himself. The Magician, the one who has that power, will not give the fruit to someone who does not deserve it.\n\nThat is why we read in the book The Mystery of the Golden Blossom, when the Master Samael Aun Weor says that the Divine Mother never rewards treason. And there is a story given of a person who was a famous Gnostic instructor who spoke beautifully about the teaching, who was practicing alchemy and transmuting his sexual forces, but was not rewarded by his Divine Mother. Why? Because he did not meditate, he did not comprehend himself. The Divine Mother could not reward him the fruits of transmutation because he did not understand how to use it. He was remaining trapped in egotistical desires.\n\nSaid another way, Gnosis is not mechanical. Self-realization is not mechanical. The process of awakening the Kundalini is not a simple theorem that says \u201cIf you take A and add it to B, you will get C.\u201d It does not work that way.\n\nGnosis, or the realization of the Self, is an act of will of the Innermost, of God. For us to receive illumination, understanding, power, transmutation, comprehension, any of the fruits of these practices, all of that is given by the Innermost. So yes, you can transmute, but if you do not meditate, if you do not comprehend yourself, your Being will give you nothing, because your Being needs you to become perfect, and perfection is achieved through comprehension of error, comprehension of oneself, comprehension of phenomenon.\n\nIf you do not understand why you have your anger, and how your anger makes you behave, then you will remain angry. If you do not understand why pride is a sin, you will remain in sin, and your Being, God, will never give power to a sinner. The Magician will not give power to a fornicator or an adulterer. The Christ cannot free someone who remains identified with their own selves.\n\nYou have a question?\n\nAudience: What you were just referring to, when you say meditation, in this sense is there any particular technique or\u2026\n\nOkay, meditation in this sense, what I am referring to, is conscious comprehension without the interference of the ego. \u2018Conscious,\u2019 meaning with the consciousness. Self-observation is the basis of it, yes, but real meditation is the activity of the consciousness free of ego.\n\nConsciousness\u2019 has to be understood in this case to know what that means. That means that to be in real meditation there is no \u201cI,\u201d there is no \u201cMe,\u201d there is no ego, there is no pride, there is no anger. You have to learn the science of meditation, how to separate from the ego, how to observe the ego as a free consciousness. In other words, you have to learn how to enter into the state of Dhyana, or Pratyahara, which is a silent mind.\n\nAnd from that process of Dhyana, Dharana, and Samadhi, we then learn how to activate the consciousness and be free from the animal mind. In that state, we are Will. We are manifesting and experiencing the two aspects of the Being as soul , Divine Soul and Human Soul, Divine Consciousness and Human Consciousness. That is what meditates. And to access that you have to separate yourself from intellect, from emotion, from sensation, from all these lower parts. And this is a discipline.\n\nThere are many techniques that can lead you to that experience, whether from Zen, or from Buddhism, or from Hinduism, even Christianity, many techniques. But the essential experience remains the same: we have to become free of the ego in order to comprehend the ego itself. The ego cannot comprehend the ego. My pride cannot comprehend itself, only my consciousness can, because my consciousness is part of the Being.\n\nAnother question?\n\nAudience: On the card, there is a symbol above the eyes. Can you explain what this represents?\n\nThe symbol above the eyes is a magical glyph, which is a kind of encoding of a Kabbalistic principle. You see three lines, but they are unified, so it is a symbol of Kether. Kether is three in one.\n\nNow, in the supporting materials for today\u2019s lecture there is a practice which is given. The practice is to meditate and visualize the symbol of infinity. There are accompanying steps and prayers related to this, to ask for assistance, to meditate and pray on the symbol of the infinity.\n\nThe beauty of this practice is that it escapes the intellect. It is a kind of koan. If you analyze the practice intellectually, you do not necessarily see why this practice is given in the First Arcanum. What does the eight have to do with the one? How does this practice work? The intellect wants to understand things in a very factual and rigid way. But this practice, the Holy Eight, is quite potent. If you relax yourself totally (relaxed physically, relaxed emotionally, relaxed mentally), allow yourself to become a little drowsy, and you perform this practice, you are working with Hermetic Magic, related to the mind. You are working to exercise the will of your consciousness to maintain attentive awareness, to maintain concentration.\n\nAudience: Do I want to perform the actual meditation on the eight?\u2026\n\nIt is up to you.\n\nSo this practice teaches you in practical terms things that the intellect cannot grasp, so I encourage you to work with this practice. Do not think about it. Do not analyze it with the intellect. Do not try and figure it out with the intellect. Just do the practice. Do the practice. Use your own natural inquisitiveness in the consciousness to investigate it, to explore it, practically speaking, not just as an idea, but actually do it.\n\nAnd the more you make the effort, the more will you put into that effort, the more benefit you will receive. If you do it once kind of half-heartedly, you probably will not get anything. The work to activate and realize the twenty-two Arcana in oneself is a work of great will. The Arcanum One is that which initiates, and any beginning is very difficult. To start anything is hard. To start a project, to start a life, to start a new marriage, to start a new job, is hard. The same is true of this type of work. It is difficult. But you have to persist. You have to keep trying. It is a matter of willpower. Relax and make the effort. Your Being is with you. Your Innermost will help you. But to do that, you have to listen to Him.\n\nAny final questions?\n\nAudience: What do you think the difference is between intuition, will, and consciousness?\n\nDifference between intuition, will, and consciousness?\n\nAudience: Is intuition part of the will, is will part of intuition, is consciousness part of\u2026 I mean, you get intuition, you say you have to know whether you are doing right or wrong. Obviously it is intuition that is going to tell you that. Now is that part of the will? Is that part of the consciousness?\n\nThat is a good question.\n\nWhat are the differences between will, consciousness, and intuition? In their heart, they are the same. In their essence, they are the same. Consciousness is a continuum of energy. Really, it is the sign of the infinite. That is consciousness. But in us it is discontinuous, right? We are paying attention one minute and we are totally asleep the next.\n\nSo, will comes into play as an effort to contain, and focus, and direct that consciousness. Will is the effort to keep that consciousness flowing in the right way. But intuition is knowing how to direct it. You see? They are one thing. When you have an intuition, you know how to direct your consciousness by will.\n\nFor example, you are walking down the street\u2014he is always walking down the street\u2014and you see an old friend, and you know from past experiences with this person that this person is very negative and loves to gossip. You have consciousness in that moment because you are working to be aware of yourself. So you are working on focusing and directing your consciousness. So right there you have conscious attention, where you observe that person. You are enforcing your will in that moment. Your mind tells you \u201cThis person always wants to gossip with me. I should avoid them.\u201d But your heart tells you, \u201cI need to talk to them.\u201d Which one do you do?\n\nMost of the time you probably listen to your mind. \u201cNo, I shouldn\u2019t talk to them. They\u2019re just going to do this and that. It is going to be terrible. Why should I even bother?\u201d But if you listen to your heart, you are listening to intuition. You might go and find that something happens in the exchange between the two of you that you needed. It could be painful, it could be pleasant, whichever.\n\nBut the distinction has to be in from moment to moment, if you are paying attention, if you are conscious, you are manifesting will. You have to listen to intuition to give you guidance how to direct that will, how to direct that consciousness through will. And it is always changing. And the mind will always try to interfere\u2014always.\n\nSo the will is \u2018control consciousness, control mind.\u2019 Keep consciousness active, keep mind passive. It is not easy, but the more you make the effort, the more you maintain continuity of observation, and the more you maintain the continuity of the remembrance of your Being, the more familiar you become.\n\nAnother question?\n\nAudience: What about the symbols, the birds, the bird up top?\u2026\n\nThe birds represent aspects of the Holy Spirit. So in this case we can say that the Holy Spirit is that bird which is part of that upper trinity, Binah, the Holy Spirit. So we have the Holy Spirit above and below. It is in both aspects. The bird is present there.\n\nIn the same way, we can relate this to the two Edens \u2013 upper and lower \u2013 because the forces of the Holy Spirit are the fires in the waters of the upper Eden, or those Akashic forces. And the fires of the Holy Spirit are in the waters of the lower Eden in our sexual forces. So here we see the presence of that divine force everywhere.\n\nOne more?\n\nAudience: What is the difference between the Holy Eight and the circle in terms of infinity?\n\nThe symbol of the infinity is showing an exchange, movement, back and forth. So you are seeing how in the upper aspects of the Tree of Life, you have unmanifest moving to manifest, and back, this flux back and forth: manifestation, unmanifestation; cosmic day, cosmic night. That is what the infinity is showing. But that symbol is penetrating all the way through the Tree of Life. The presence of that exchange, back and forth, of forces.\n\nThe symbol of the dot in the circle is, for me, more of a picture of one instant. It is capturing the one little photograph, one little frame, of that manifestation out of the womb, that in truth, when you look at how the tree functions, it is in constant motion. The manifestation into manifestation is movement. So that is how I understand the distinction between them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
