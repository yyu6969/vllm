    "prompt": "Take the 2-minute tour \u00d7\n\nI'm slowly grasping this, though the different formulations of type theory make it difficult.\n\nIn http://imps.mcmaster.ca/doc/seven-virtues.pdf types can only be formed from *, i, and a->b when a and b are Types.\n\nIn http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWuWpLTiM3g (9:00) types can be constructed more liberally where A and B are Types then A or B, A and B, A implies B. However later in the video it is mentioned that a higher order type system could be constructed.\n\nWhat I think I understand: Types are statements and their inhabitants are proofs. Since there is no way (that I can see) to quantify over these types they would define a simple predicate logic. Is this a correct assessment?\n\nHow can a type theory that allows quantification over types be constructed?\n\nshare|improve this question\n\n2 Answers 2\n\nMartin-L\u00f6f type theory has free variables. If $A$ is type and the free variable $x$ is of type $A$, then we can think of $B(x)$ as a family of types indexed by $A$. We can then form the product type, written $\\Pi_{x \\in A} B(x)$ corresponding to product or universal quantification, and the sum type $\\Sigma_{x \\in A}B(x)$ corresponding to disjoint union or existential quantification.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nIt seems that what you seen is simply typed lambda calculus, in which types form an algebra freely generated by basic types via the operations $+$,$\\times$ and $\\rightarrow$.\n\nFor the Curry-Howard isomorphism you can identify types with proposition of the intuizionistic propositional logic and so the type operations $+$,$\\times$ and $\\rightarrow$ become $\\lor$,$\\land$ and $\\rightarrow$ respectively. But in this case you're dealing with a propositional logic, not a predicative one.\n\nAs aws pointed out above to extend the Curry-Howard isomorphism from propositional calculus to first order logic you need to extend your type theory to have dependents type, and if I'm not mistaken that is exactly what Martin L\u00f6f did: trying to extend Curry Howard isomorphism to predicates it created the his dependent type theory. In dependent type theory types are terms which can contain variables, since types correspond to propositions, is natural to reguard dependent types (i.e. types with variables) as dependent propositions (i.e. predicates).\n\nIf you're interested to go deep in such type theory I suggest to you to take a look this link and if you want to go even deeper I suggest to take a look to first chapter of Homotopy type theory book.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nYour Answer\n\n\n<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>",

I am wandering whether it is possible to do parallel computation for different functions.\n\nA simple is example is to calculate the difference f-g of two independent functions f and g. How can I ask SageMath to simultaneously compute the values of f and g, and then calculate the difference?\n\nMy time measurements suggest that when calculating the difference f-g, SageMath actually calculates f and g one after another, and then take the difference.\n\nI can think of a naive approach using the @parallel decoration. I can create a function whose input variable is the name of the functions I want to compute simultaneously. Then I use a list of function names as input to get a generator of outputs. This may work if the final result doesn't depend on the order of the outputs, but does not work if the order matters, for example when taking the difference.\n\nIn general, suppose I have a flow chart for the computation, in other words, I already know which jobs can be parallelized and how the information flows to the next stage. Then what is the best way to implement the flow chart?\n\nedit retag flag offensive close merge delete\n\n1 Answer\n\nSort by \u00bb oldest newest most voted\n\nanswered 2020-02-21 21:31:46 +0200\n\nvdelecroix gravatar image\n\nThe @parallel decorator is based on the multiprocessing Python library. It is nothing advanced and only allows you to perform embarassingly parallel computations (ie no dependence between each individual computation).\n\nIf you want more advanced parallelization, a flow chart is not enough as it does not take into account the cost of a given computation. Let us imagine that you have 2 processors for the following tasks\n\n  \u2022 A1, A2, A3 that takes respectively 1min, 1min, 3min\n  \u2022 B that takes 1min and depends on A1, A2, A3\n\nThen, doing it blindly you will start the computation with A1, A2 simultaneously. They will roughly finish at the same time and then A3 will run alone for 3 min.\n\nEven with the assumption that you can give a rough approximation of the time of each task, the scheduling problem is algorithmically non-trivial (ie unlikely to be solved on large instances). I don't know of any Python implementation of something in that direction.\n\nedit flag offensive delete link more\n\nYour Answer\n\n\nAdd Answer\n\nQuestion Tools\n\n1 follower\n\n\nAsked: 2020-02-21 08:37:16 +0200\n\n",

The RI/FS process is designed to help determine what, if any, action should be taken at a Superfund site. The purpose of the Remedial Investigation (RI) portion is to determine what contaminants are associated with the site and how large an area is contaminated. An important part of the RI is the risk assessment. All Superfund site risk assessments should be comprised of two parts, a human health risk assessment and an ecological risk assessment. The purpose of the Feasibility Study (FS) is to evaluate the choices of a remedy to address site-related risks.\u00a0Only wildlife is considered in an Ecological Risk Assessment (ERA); domesticated animals or domesticated plants are excluded from the ERA. The process for performing an ERA is described in detail in the Ecological Risk Assessment Guidance for Superfund, Process for Designing and Conducting Ecological Risk Assessments (EPA 540-R-97-006). The main steps of an ERA are outlined in the Eight-step Overview found on this website. \u00a0\n\nDefinition of Ecological Risk Assessment (ERA)\n\nEcological Risk Assessment is defined as \"A process that evaluates the likelihood that adverse ecological effects are occurring or may occur as a result of exposure to one or more stressors\" (U.S. EPA 1992b). As used in Superfund, the phrase \"ecological risk assessment\" means an investigation into the actual or potential impacts of contaminants from a hazardous waste site on plants and animals other than humans or domesticated species. A risk does not exist unless: (1) the contaminant has the ability to cause an adverse effect and (2) a plant or animal can come in contact with a contaminant long enough and at a high enough concentration that the contaminant causes an adverse effect.\n\nGoals of the Ecological Risk Assessment (ERA)\n\nThere are four main goals of an ecological risk assessment (ERA):\u00a0\n\n  1. To determine whether harmful effects are likely for wild animals or plants exposed to site related hazardous chemicals; these harmful effects are referred to as a significant risk;\n  2. If there is significant risk, to calculate a protective cleanup level that would reduce the risk to wild animals or plants;\n  3. To determine the potential impact of cleanup activities on the habitats, plants, or animals; and\n  4. To provide information that can be used as a baseline for long-term biological monitoring programs to determine if the cleanup is effective.\u00a0\n\nLocal Navigation\n\nJump to main content.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>",

    "output": " a rigorous set of exams, the Diploma Programme is a challenging pre-university course of study that leads to external examinations. It is respected by leading universities across North America and around the world.\nThe curriculum is made up of six subject groups and a core. Students take courses from each subject group, except for the arts and the elective group, where they may choose to focus on either one or two subjects.\nThe IB diploma programme requires students to:\n\n- study six subjects, including two modern languages;\n\n-study a broad range of subjects rather than just a few subjects narrowly defined;\n\n-complete two-year, in-depth study in each subject;\n\n- write an extended essay on a topic of your choice;\n\n-take part in a programme called CAS (Creativity, Action, Service), which focuses on extracurricular activities;\n\n-complete a theory of knowledge course, which helps them reflect on their learning;\n\n- learn a second language;\n\n- complete a research project.\n\nThe IB Diploma is not a qualification but a programme. It is awarded to students who have completed all of the above requirements successfully. Because there are no final examinations for the IB Diploma, and because it takes into account students' performance throughout the two-year programme, it is considered more balanced and holistic than other qualifications. It also allows for more flexibility and creativity in subject choices. For example, students can choose a second science or second mathematics course in addition to the first, or they can choose a second language instead. This means that students can really tailor the IB Diploma to meet their own needs and interests, while still completing the full programme.

    "prompt": "I'm using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to examine how normal (or Gaussian) some data sets I have are. I am having trouble with interpreting the $p$-values (surprise surprise).\n\nMy present understanding is that if the returned $p$-value is $p > 0.05$ this suggests that the data is normally distributed, while datasets which produce a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test result $p < 0.05$ suggest that the data is not normally distributed.\n\nFirstly, is my present understanding/interpretation correct?\n\nSecondly I performed some very basic simulations. I simply generate data sets with $1000$ points which are normally distributed and perform a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test on each one. If I look at the distribution of $p$-values extracted from this, I see a square distribution with values ranging between 0 and 1.\n\nI don't understand this -- I guess I don't really understand $p$-values as I expected for data which definitely is normally distributed (I generated it to be such) that there would be a median $p$-value.\n\n\n1 Answer 1\n\n\nYou're on the right track. Two facts are key for understanding what's going on.\n\nFirst, the null hypothesis $(H_\\emptyset$) of the one-sample K-S test is that the sample data comes from the \"reference\" distribution. When it is being used as a normality test, that reference distribution is a Gaussian.\n\nSecond, for any test, p-values are uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 under the null hypothesis, assuming the test's assumptions are met. See this question for more details. While you should expect small $p$-values if the alternate hypothesis were true, it is not the case that you should expect only large $p$-values under the null hypothesis.\n\nCombining these two facts accounts for your simulation: you set up conditions where the null hypothesis is definitely true, and the resulting p-values form a \"square\" histogram where each bin has approximately the same number of values. If you were to draw samples from a different distribution (e.g., an exponential distribution), you would instead find $p$-values clustered near 0, since it is unlikely that those values could have come from a Gaussian (your $H_\\emptyset$).\n\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ I think I understand a bit more now. So while I observe a square or uniform distribution, I can say 95% of the data sets satisfy the the K-S tests?

    "prompt": "Laerd Statistics LoginCookies & Privacy\n\nDependent t-test for paired samples\n\nWhat does this test do?\n\nThe dependent t-test (also called the paired t-test or paired-samples t-test) compares the means of two related groups to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference between these means.\n\nWhat variables do you need for a dependent t-test?\n\nYou need one dependent variable that is measured on an interval or ratio scale (see our Types of Variable guide if you need clarification). You also need one categorical variable that has only two related groups.\n\n\nWhat is meant by \"related groups\"?\n\nA dependent t-test is an example of a \"within-subjects\" or \"repeated-measures\" statistical test. This indicates that the same participants are tested more than once. Thus, in the dependent t-test, \"related groups\" indicates that the same participants are present in both groups. The reason that it is possible to have the same participants in each group is because each participant has been measured on two occasions on the same dependent variable. For example, you might have measured the performance of 10 participants in a spelling test (the dependent variable) before and after they underwent a new form of computerised teaching method to improve spelling. You would like to know if the computer training improved their spelling performance. Here, we can use a dependent t-test because we have two related groups. The first related group consists of the participants at the beginning (prior to) the computerised spell training and the second related group consists of the same participants, but now at the end of the computerised training.\n\n\nDoes the dependent t-test test for \"changes\" or \"differences\" between related groups?\n\nThe dependent t-test can be used to test either a \"change\" or a \"difference\" in means between two related groups, but not both at the same time. Whether you are measuring a \"change\" or \"difference\" between the means of the two related groups depends on your study design. The two types of study design are indicated in the following diagrams.\n\nHow do you detect differences between experimental conditions using the dependent t-test?\n\nThe dependent t-test can look for \"differences\" between means when participants are measured on the same dependent variable under two different conditions. For example, you might have tested participants' eyesight (dependent variable) when wearing two different types of spectacle (independent variable).

Now the condition of equal pressure will be found when the perpendicular distance of those two points is same from the surface(can be regarded as the apparent depth of the point).\n\nApplying that condition you should get your answer.

This is because at the free surface, the normal component of the weight of the liquid is zero (the net force due to gravity is entirely tangential to the surface). So even if we are accelerating the container horizontally, the free surface will adjust itself so as to remain parallel to the ground.\n\nTherefore, if the container is open, and if we wish to have the same pressure at two points A and B which are at the same vertical level, we would need to have the horizontal distances between those points and the wall of the container to be equal.\n\nIn the given problem, since the two points are equidistant from the vertical wall of the cube, the pressure at those points would be equal if we have acceleration a = 0.\n\nFor a closed container with a fixed volume, the free surface of the liquid would no longer remain parallel to the ground. We can obtain the equation of the free surface as follows:\n\nLet us consider an infinitesimal element of the liquid as shown below, with density \\(\\rho\\) and dimensions dx, dy and dz. The forces acting on the element along the x-direction are :\n\n  \u2022 Pressure force on face A, acting towards left = -P\\(dxdy\\)\n  \u2022 Pressure force on face B, acting towards right = P\\(dxdy\\)\n  \u2022 Weight of the element along x-axis = \\(-\\rho g z dxdydz \\cos{\\theta} = -\\rho g z dxdydz \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^2+z^2}}\\)\n  \u2022 Pseudo force due to acceleration a = \\(\\rho a x dxdydz\\)\n\nHere, \\(\\theta\\) is the angle made by the line OP with the horizontal.\n\nSince the element is not accelerating along the x-direction, the sum of these forces has to be zero :\n\n\\[-Pdxdy + Pdxdy - \\rho g z dxdydz \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^2+z^2}} + \\rho a x dxdydz = 0 \\]\n\n\\[ => \\frac{dP}{dx} = \\rho a - \\rho g z \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^2+z^2}} \\]\n\nThis equation gives us the variation of"

For this, we need to write our own function definition.\n\nKeep a count variable to store the count and pos to track the starting index of the sub-string. When the sub-string is encountered, increment the counter and check from the next index.\n\nThis is how we calculate the overlapping substrings.\n\ndef frequencyCount(string, substr):\n    count = 0\n    pos = 0\n    while (True):\n        pos = string.find(substr, pos)\n        if pos > -1:\n            count = count + 1\n            pos += 1\n    return count\n\nprint(\"The count is: \", frequencyCount(\"thatthathat\", \"that\"))\n\nOutput: 2\n\nDo comment if you have any doubts and suggestions on this tutorial.\n\nIDE:\u00a0PyCharm\u00a02020.1 (Community Edition)\nmacOS 10.15.4\nPython 3.7",
