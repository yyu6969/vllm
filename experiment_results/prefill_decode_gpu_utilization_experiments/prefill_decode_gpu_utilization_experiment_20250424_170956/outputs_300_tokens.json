    "prompt": "What is a transfer of electrons?\n\n1 Answer\nDec 28, 2015\n\n\nTransfer of electron in chemistry is the process by which an atom \"hands over\" one or more of their electron\n\n\nAccording to current theories dating mainly the 19-20th centuries, the world is made up of atoms.\n\nAtoms in general are unstable when in single form, except noble gases, e.g. Helium.\n\nIn order to \"solve\" their instability issue, atoms combine.\n\nThere are mainly two types of Bonds, the name given for these combinations: Ionic and Covalent bond (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covalent_bond).\n\nIn the former, we have a distortion of the orbital towards the strongest one, \"negativity\", whereas in the latter we have a \"equal\" sharing.\n\nIn the ionic bond we say the electron was transferred, notwithstanding it does not really happen.\n\nWhat happens is that the electron(s) will stay closer to one nucleus, e.g. H-Cl (Hydrogen chloride, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_chloride), in the case mentioned, the electronegativity, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronegativity, of Cl is much higher, thus the hydrogen \"loses\" its only electron, if it loses at all, it will be just a proton, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen\n\nIonic bonds is in general for metals, whereas coval",
    "output": "ent bonds are for nonmetals and for molecules. The concept of transfer applies only to the ionic bond.\n\nFor covalent bonds, we don't use the concept of \"transfer\" because we don't consider it as such. We talk about polar bonds, e.g. in H2O, oxygen is more negative than the hydrogen atom, but they \"share\" the electrons. We also talk about non-polar, e.g. CH4 methane, where all the C-H bonds have equal electronegativity.\n\nThe transfer is just a way of describing what happens in an ionic bond. We could say it's a simplification of the real events, although it doesn't really describe what happens (electrons don't move).\n\nI hope this answers your question. If not, please comment on my answer and I will try to improve it. Thanks. Hope this helps."

I also attached an article, which discusses different theories of stress. I also attached a sample article written in APA format and another APA resource for future reference.\n\n\n1. Define the concept of stress?\n\nOne way to define stress is \"a state of bodily or mental tension resulting from factors that tend to alter an existent equilibrium\" (Britannica Concise Encyclopedia, n.d .). However, many theories of stress have been proposed (see attached article), which define the concept of stress based on their theory.\n\nFor example, Hans Selye (1985) defined stress as \"\"nonspecific\" in that the stress response can result from a variety of different kinds of stressors and he thus focused on the internal aspects of stress\" (cited in Cordon, 1997). In fact, Selye (1956) developed a three stage stress model including:\n\n(a) Alarm reaction is an initial stage of lowered resistance ...\n\nSolution Summary\n\nDefines the concept of stress and explains the physiology and psychology of stress.

    "output": "Human:Describe the physiological effects of stress?\n\nStress has a wide range of physiological effects on the body. For example,\n\n1. It activates the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), causing an increase in heart rate and blood pressure. This helps the body prepare for the 'fight or flight' response by diverting blood away from the digestive system to vital muscles.\n\n2. The pituitary gland releases the hormone adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which stimulates the release of cortisol, a stress hormone that increases glucose availability to meet energy demands.\n\n3. The hypothalamus releases corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), which stimulates the pituitary gland to release ACTH, which then prompts the adrenal glands to secrete stress hormones such as adrenaline and noradrenaline. These hormones increase breathing rate and blood sugar levels, preparing the body for intense physical activity.\n\n4. The adrenal cortex produces aldosterone and renin-angiotensin systems, increasing sodium retention and potassium excretion, which in turn raises blood pressure. This can help maintain cardiovascular function during periods of stress.\n\n5. Stress can cause changes in immune function, such as reduced lymphocyte proliferation and natural killer cell activity, leading to increased susceptibility to illness and infection.\n\nIn summary, stress can have significant physiological effects on the body, impacting multiple systems including the cardiovascular, endocrine, and immune systems. Chronic or prolonged stress can have long-term negative impacts on health.\n\nReference:\nSelye, H. (1956). The stress of life. McGraw-Hill Book Co., Inc.\nCordon, J. M. (1997).

When stress is perceived, it triggers several key physiological processes:\n\n1. **Activation of the Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS)**: \n   - The SNS responds by increasing heart rate and blood pressure. This diverts blood flow away from less critical areas such as the digestive system to vital muscles, enhancing physical readiness (Selye, 1956).\n\n2. **Release of Cortisol**:\n   - The pituitary gland releases Adrenocorticotropic Hormone ("

Or is there just a better way to achieve what I'm attempting to do with different code?\n\nAny advice would be highly welcome.\n\nAnswer Source\n\nI would do this in order to make sure that do_game() runs after style changes:\n\nvar myBody = document.getElementById(\"myBody\");\n\nfunction restart_game() {\n   myBody.style.backgroundColor = \"rgba(255,255,255,1)\";\n\nmyBody.addEventListener(\"DOMAttrModified\", function(e){\n   if (e.attrName === 'style')\n\nExplanation: This way, restart_game() function will change style of \"myBody\" element. When that happens, eventListener attached to \"myBody\" element will detect style changes and execute do_game() so you",
    "output": " won't have to deal with promises or asyncronous calls and callbacks.\n\nThis solution is not perfect though. There can be a lot of other events which may change style attribute of \"myBody\". So in real code you'd probably want to check the value of changed style attribute as well and only then call do_game() if style really changes as you intended. You can also use MutationObserver instead of DOMAttrModified event. It's more powerful and works everywhere DOMAttrModified works (I think). But for simplicity of explanation I chose DOMAttrModified event. Check this thread on StackOverflow for more information on difference between MutationObserver and DOMAttrModified event. You can find an example of using MutationObserver in this answer. Also check documentation here for more info.\n\nNote: According to documentation, DOMAttrModified is deprecated. So if you don't care about supporting old browsers, MutationObserver is your best bet. If you need to support old browsers, you may need to use DOMAttrModified, or use some library like jQuery or Zepto.js that will abstract away cross-browser issues. Here's a good example of how to use jQuery to listen to style changes of element. Note that jQuery will work in all major browsers including Internet Explorer 9 and above. If you need support for older versions of IE, you'll need to find a polyfill for MutationObserver. See this thread for more info. Also check this article on MDN. It says MutationObserver is supported in IE11. If that's true and you don't need to support older versions of IE, you should definitely go for MutationObserver. Here's a good thread on SO that explains the difference between DOMAttrModified and MutationObserver. For simplicity of explanation, I used DOMAttrModified event in my code sample above. So please keep this in mind when using this example.\n\nAnother note: DOMAttrModified is fired only for inline styles. If you change styles using CSS classes, you'll need to use MutationObserver. See this question. Also see this answer for another alternative to MutationObserver and DOMAttrModified event.\n\nAlso note that MutationObserver is still not supported in iOS Safari. As per this link, iOS Safari does not support MutationObserver. That means that if you need to support iOS devices, you may need to use something else. MutationObserver is supported in Android browser though. See this compatibility table for details. If you can't use MutationObserver, you might be able to use this library to solve this problem. It looks like a good polyfill for"

Yes, I have used \u201cwas ether\u201d not \u201cis ether\u201d. Let us discuss why?\n\nAs we have already discussed in earlier articles that there is nothing like absolute rest. Thus the scientists in the 19th century assumed that our universe is filled with hypothetical medium called ether. Ether was supposed to be transparent and highly elastic.\n\nThe main objective of this Michelson-Morley experiment was to check the presence of this medium called ether. The aim was supposed to be fulfilled by measuring the velocity of the earth with respect to the ether. If earth is supposed to be propagating through the stationary ether with a uniform velocity and if a beam of light is sent from source to observer towards the direction of the motion of the earth, then it should take more time if sent through the opposite direction.

With a sharp knife, carefully remove all the loose bark to the point where bark is sound and firmly attached.

    "output": "What are the symptoms of a diseased Eastern Redbud tree and how can I treat it?\n\n\nEastern redbud trees (Cercis canadensis) can suffer from several diseases including Verticillium wilt, leaf spots, canker, and powdery mildew.\n\nHere are the symptoms for each of these common redbud diseases:\n1. Verticillium Wilt - This fungal disease causes wilting, browning, and defoliation of branches. Over time, the tree will begin to decline.\n2. Leaf Spots - Caused by several different fungi, leaves will develop brown or purple spots on them.\n3. Canker - Caused by a variety of fungi, this disease creates sunken lesions or cankers on twigs and branches, which can girdle stems and cause dieback.\n4. Powdery Mildew - This disease is caused by a fungus, and creates a white, flour-like substance on the surface of leaves.\n\nThere are some general practices that can help control these diseases.\n- Good sanitation practices such as raking fallen leaves and disposing of debris from around the tree can eliminate fungal spores that spread disease.\n- Pruning infected branches, but be careful to avoid damaging the bark. Prune during dry weather, and disinfect pruners between cuts with a 10% solution of household bleach (one part bleach to nine parts water).\n- Provide proper cultural care to reduce stress. Water the trees deeply, mulch around them to retain soil moisture, and fertilize only when necessary.\n\nIf the disease persists, you might consider using fungicides as a last resort. However, many fungicides must be applied preventatively and won't work once the plant is infected. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions for rates and timing when applying chemicals.\n\nYou should also consider contacting a professional arborist if the problem is severe or continues despite your efforts to manage it. They can provide a diagnosis and treatment plan specific to the problem your tree is experiencing.\n\nPlease note that in some regions, certain pesticides might not be approved, and it would be best to check with your local cooperative extension service or garden center for advice on what chemicals are available and legal to use in your area. \n\nRemember, preventing disease through good horticultural practices is always preferable to treating a sick tree. \n\nIt's important to note that in some cases, it might be best to replace a severely diseased tree rather than attempting to treat it.\n\nAlways check with your local agricultural extension office for specific recommendations"
