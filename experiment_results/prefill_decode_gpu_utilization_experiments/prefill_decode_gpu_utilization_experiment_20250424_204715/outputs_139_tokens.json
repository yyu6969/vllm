This configuration is incorrect because the MTU must match the ppp-max-payload that is defined.\nB. This configuration is incorrect because the dialer interface number must be the same as the dialer pool number.\nC. This configuration is missing an IP address on the dialer interface.\nD.

    "prompt": "A one-year insurance policy pays $10822 if the policyholder dies within one year. The premium paid by the policyholder is $351, and the probability of death within that year is 0.006. What is the expected gain of the policy for the insurance company?\n\n1 Answer\nApr 13, 2018\n\nThe expected gain is #$286.07#.\n\n\nThe expected gain for the insurance company is the revenue for the policy minus the cost for the policy\n\nThe revenue for the policy is $351.\n\nThe cost for the policy is the expected value of the benefit of the policy.\n\nThe expected value of the policy is the amount that the policy pays times the probability of paying.\n\n\nexpected gain = revenue #-# payout #xx# probability of payout",
    "output": "\n\nexpected gain = $351 - ($10822 #xx# 0.006)\n\nexpected gain = $351 - $64.93\n\nexpected gain = $286.07# or $286.10 to the nearest tenth of a dollar. The insurance company can be expected to gain about $286.10 on the average policy. It should be noted that there will be some policies which result in a loss for the company. However, the more policies sold, the closer the actual gain will approach the expected gain. The expected gain"

    "prompt": "How are factors and products related?\n\n1 Answer\nMar 19, 2018\n\nFactors are what you multiply to get a product.\n\n\nIn a multiplication problem, there are two types of numbers. Factors, and products. Factors are going to be #color(green)(green)# and products are going to be #color(red)(red#.\n\n\nThat is how factors (what you are mulltiplying) and products (what you end up with) are related.",
    "output": " The numbers being multiplied together are called factors and the answer to a multiplication problem is called a product.\n\nFor example:\n\n#\"3\" xx \"4\" = \"12\"#\n\n#color(green)(\"3\")# and #color(green)(\"4\")# are factors and #color(red)(\"12\")# is the product. Another way to say this is 3 and 4 are the factors of 12. It's like saying 12 is made by multiplying 3 and 4. Or 12 is a multiple of 3 and 4.\n\nYou can have more than 2 factors though."

    "prompt": "Which one is correctly matched?\n\n[wp_quiz id=\u201d14284\u2033]\n\nThe correctly matched pair is AIDS virus-Reverse transcriptase.\n\nAcquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome is caused due to the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in humans. HIV is a retrovirus belonging to the family Retroviridae. The genome of HIV consists of two single-stranded positive-sense RNA enclosed inside a capsid.\n\nTo replicate its RNA, HIV uses an enzyme called Reverse transcriptase. The enzyme Reverse transcriptase generates complementary DNA (cDNA) using the viral RNA as a template. The process of synthesis of DNA from RNA is called Reverse Transcription.",
    "output": " The cDNA is then incorporated into the host\u2019s genome where it integrates and replicates using the host cellular machinery.\n\nThus, AIDS virus and reverse transcriptase are correctly matched. Other options do not match with each other. For example, BCG vaccine is used for the prevention of tuberculosis. Cholera toxin is produced by the bacteria Vibrio cholerae.\n\nLeave a Comment\n\n\n\nFree Class"
