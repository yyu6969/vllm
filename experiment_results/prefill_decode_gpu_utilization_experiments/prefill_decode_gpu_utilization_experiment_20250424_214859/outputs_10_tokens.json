    "prompt": "Describe how neural networks process data to find patterns.",
    "output": " Neural networks are a type of machine learning algorithm that are designed to mimic the structure and function of the human brain. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes, or neurons, which work together to process and analyze input data.\n\nWhen data is fed into a neural network, it is first passed through an input layer, where each node represents a feature or variable in the dataset. The input layer then passes the data onto one or more hidden layers, which perform computations on the input data using weights and biases. These weights and biases are essentially coefficients that determine the strength of the connections between nodes, and they are adjusted during training to optimize the network's"
