    "prompt": "Describe how neural networks process data to find patterns.",
    "output": " Neural networks process data through a series of layers that transform the input data into an output that can be used for prediction or classification. The data is passed through each layer, and at each layer, the neurons in the network apply some mathematical operations on the data. These operations involve weights and biases, which are adjusted during training to improve the accuracy of the network's predictions.\n\nThe first layer of a neural network, known as the input layer, receives the raw data. The subsequent layers are called hidden layers, and they extract increasingly complex features from the data. Each neuron in these hidden layers receives input from the previous layer and applies a transformation function"
