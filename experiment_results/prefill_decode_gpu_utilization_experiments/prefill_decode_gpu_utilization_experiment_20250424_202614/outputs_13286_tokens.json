Read the following extract and answer the questions that follow :\n\nThe Laburnum top is silent, quite still\nIn the afternoon yellow September sunlight,\nA few leaves yellowing, all its seeds fallen.\nTill the goldfinch comes, with a twitching chirrup\nA suddenness, a startlement, at a branch end.\nThen sleek as a lizard, and alert, and abrupt,\nShe enters the thickness, and a machine starts up\nOf chitterings, and a tremor of wings, and trillings\nThe whole tree trembles and thrills.\nIt is the engine of her family.\nShe stokes it full, then flirts out to a branch-end\nShowing her barred face identity mask.\nThen with eerie delicate whistle-chirrup whisperings\nShe launches away, towards the infinite\nAnd the laburnum subsides to empty.\n\n[Without goldfinch (a small singing bird with yellow feathers on its wings) the laburnum tree remains standing lifeless. But just as the goldfinch comes on it, it comes alive. With the departure of the bird, it again becomes calm and lifeless]\n\nWord-Meanings : laburnum = \u0905\u092e\u0932\u0924\u093e\u0938 \u0915\u093e \u0935\u0943\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0964 quite = \u092a\u0942\u0930\u0940 \u0924\u0930\u0939 \u0938\u0947 still = \u0938\u094d\u0925\u093f\u0930\u0964 sunlight = \u0927\u0942\u092a\u0964 yellowing = \u092a\u0940\u0932\u0940 \u0939\u094b \u0930\u0939\u0940\u0902\u0964 fallen = \u0917\u093f\u0930 \u091a\u0941\u0915\u0947\u0964 goldfinch = \u0938\u094b\u0928\u091a\u093f\u0921\u093c\u0940 (\u0938\u094b\u0928\u091a\u093f\u0921\u093c\u093f\u092f\u093e)\u0964 twitching = \u090f\u0915 \u091d\u091f\u0915\u0947 \u0915\u0947 \u0938\u093e\u0925\u0964 chirrup = \u091a\u0939\u091a\u0939\u093e\u0939\u091f\u0964 suddenness = \u0905\u091a\u093e\u0928\u0915 \u0939\u094b\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u093e \u092d\u093e\u0935\u0964 startlement = \u091a\u094c\u0902\u0915 \u091c\u093e\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u093e \u092d\u093e\u0935\u0964 end = \u091b\u094b\u0930, \u0915\u093f\u0928\u093e\u0930\u093e\u0964 sleek = \u091a\u093f\u0915\u0928\u0940, \u091a\u092e\u0915\u0926\u093e\u0930\u0964 lizard = \u091b\u093f\u092a\u0915\u0932\u093f\u0964 abrupt = \u0905\u091a\u093e\u0928\u0915, \u0905\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0936\u093f\u0924\u0964 thickness = \u0938\u0927\u0928\u0924\u093e\u0964 chitterings = \u091a\u0939\u091a\u0939\u093e\u091f\u0947\u0902\u0964 tremor = \u0924\u0940\u0935\u094d\u0930 \u0915\u092e\u094d\u092a\u0928\u094d\u0928\u0964 trillings = \u0924\u0940\u0935\u094d\u0930 \u0938\u094d\u0935\u0930\u0964 trembles = \u0915\u093e\u0901\u092a \u0909\u0920\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948\u0964 thrills = \u0930\u094b\u092e\u093e\u0902\u091a\u093f\u0924 \u0939\u094b \u0909\u0920\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948\u0964 flirts out = \u092b\u0941\u0926\u0915\u0924\u0940 \u0939\u0948\u0964 barred = \u0927\u093e\u0930\u0940\u0926\u093e\u0930\u0964 eerie = \u0905\u0926\u094d\u092d\u0941\u0924\u0964 delicate = \u0928\u093e\u091c\u0941\u0915\u0964 whistle-chirrup = \u0938\u0940\u091f\u0940 \u091c\u0948\u0938\u0940 \u091a\u0939\u091a\u0939\u093e\u0939\u091f \u0915\u0940 \u0906\u0935\u093e\u091c\u0964 infinite = \u0905\u0928\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0964 subsides = \u0936\u093e\u0902\u0924 \u0930\u0939 \u091c\u093e\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948\u0964 empty = \u0916\u093e\u0932\u0940\u0964\n\n\n  1.

    "prompt": "Address of a variable\n\nFrom Rosetta Code\nAddress of a variable\n\nBasic Data Operation\nThis is a basic data operation. It represents a fundamental action on a basic data type.\n\nYou may see other such operations in the Basic Data Operations category, or:\n\nInteger Operations\nArithmetic | Comparison\n\nBoolean Operations\nBitwise | Logical\n\nString Operations\nConcatenation | Interpolation | Comparison | Matching\n\nMemory Operations\nPointers & references | Addresses\n\n\nDemonstrate how to get the address of a variable and how to set the address of a variable.\n\n360 Assembly[edit]\n\nGet the Address[edit]\n\nTo get the address of a variable, use LA (load address) instead of L (load):\n\n         LA    R3,I                load address of I\n\nSet the Address[edit]\n\nTo set a variable dynamically at the same address of an other variable, use a DSECT (dummy section):\n\n         USING MYDSECT,R12 \nLA R12,I set @[email\u00a0protected]\nL R2,J now J is at the same location as I\n\n\nGet The Address[edit]\n\nThe_Address\u00a0: System.Address;\nI\u00a0: Integer;\nThe_Address\u00a0:= I'Address;\n\nSet The Address[edit]\n\nSet the address of a variable to address A100 in hexadecimal\n\nI\u00a0: Integer;\nfor I'Address use 16#A100#;\n\nSet the address of one variable to the address of another variable, creating an overlay.\n\nI\u00a0: Integer;\nJ\u00a0: Integer;\nfor I'Address use J'Address;\n\nALGOL 68[edit]\n\nBasically ALGOL 68 refuses to let the programmer access the memory directly. The language does allow \"references\" any variables. These references are effectively the address a particular variable. But the value of the actual address is not available for printing or any arithmetic.\n\n[4]INT test := (222,444,666,888);\nREF INT reference := test[3];\nREF INT(reference) := reference + 111;\nprint((\"test value is now: \",test))\ntest value is now:        +222       +444       +777       +888\n\nThe other reason specific addresses are using in languages like C to manipulate devices. For this purpose site are expected to implement channels for their programmers to use. To quote the ALGOL 68 Revised Report: A \"channel\" corresponds to one or more physical devices (e.g., a card reader, a card punch or a line printer, or even to a set up in nuclear physics the results of which are collected by the computer), or to a filestore maintained by the operating system[1].\n\nTo establish a channel with such a device there is a special standard procedure:\nPROC establish = (REF FILE file, STRING idf, CHANNEL chan, INT p, l, c) INT: ~\n\nWhere the idf string is text describing which device to open, and possibly options. And chan is the actual device type. Standard CHANNELs in ALGOL 68 are stand in channel, stand out channel, and stand back channel. These determine the type of the pre opened stdio FILEs stand in, stand out, and stand back. A site would be expected to implement their own CHANNELs for network connections, database queries and particle accelerators etc.\n\n\nGet the address[edit]\n\nWorks with: Argile version 1.0.0\nuse std, array\t\t(: array.arg also defines pointer operators\u00a0:)\nlet var = 42\nlet ptr = &var (: value of ptr is address of var\u00a0:)\nprint var (: prints 42\u00a0:)\n(*ptr)++ (: increments value pointed by ptr\u00a0:)\nprint var (: prints 43\u00a0:)\n\nSet the address[edit]\n\nSince we cannot set address of a variable, we use a macro that returns a reference.\n\nWorks with: Argile version 1.0.0\nuse std, array\n=:mac:= -> int& { * (0x400000 as int*) }\nprintf \"%x\\n\" mac (: may crash depending on operating system\u00a0:)\n\nARM Assembly[edit]\n\nWorks with: as version Raspberry Pi\n/* ARM assembly Raspberry PI */\n/* program adrvar.s */\n/* Constantes */\n.equ STDOUT, 1\n.equ WRITE, 4\n.equ EXIT, 1\n/* Initialized data */\nszMessage: .asciz \"Hello. \\n \" @ message\nszRetourLigne: .asciz \"\\n\"\niValDeb: .int 5 @ value 5 in array of 4 bytes\n/* No Initialized data */\niValeur: .skip 4 @ reserve 4 bytes in memory\n.global main\nldr r0,=szMessage @ adresse of message short program\nbl affichageMess @ call function\n@ or\nldr r0,iAdrszMessage @ adresse of message big program (size code > 4K)\nbl affichageMess @ call function\nldr r1,=iValDeb @ adresse of variable -> r1 short program\nldr r0,[r1] @ value of iValdeb -> r0\nldr r1,iAdriValDeb @ adresse of variable -> r1 big program\n/* set variables */\nldr r1,=iValeur @ adresse of variable -> r1 short program\nstr r0,[r1] @ value of r0 -> iValeur\nldr r1,iAdriValeur @ adresse of variable -> r1 big program\n/* end of program */\nmov r0, #0 @ return code\nmov r7, #EXIT @ request to exit program\nswi 0 @ perform the system call\niAdriValDeb: .int iValDeb\niAdriValeur: .int iValeur\niAdrszMessage: .int szMessage\niAdrszRetourLigne: .int szRetourLigne\n/* affichage des messages avec calcul longueur */\n/* r0 contient l adresse du message */\npush {fp,lr} /* save des 2 registres */\npush {r0,r1,r2,r7} /* save des autres registres */\nmov r2,#0 /* compteur longueur */\n1: /*calcul de la longueur */\nldrb r1,[r0,r2] /* recup octet position debut + indice */\ncmp r1,#0 /* si 0 c est fini */\nbeq 1f\nadd r2,r2,#1 /* sinon on ajoute 1 */\nb 1b\n1: /* donc ici r2 contient la longueur du message */\nmov r1,r0 /* adresse du message en r1 */\nmov r0,#STDOUT /* code pour \u00e9crire sur la sortie standard Linux */\nmov r7, #WRITE /* code de l appel systeme 'write' */\nswi #0 /* appel systeme */\npop {r0,r1,r2,r7} /* restaur des autres registres */\npop {fp,lr} /* restaur des 2 registres */\nbx lr /* retour procedure */\n\n\nvar num = 12\nvar pointer = ptr(num) # get pointer\nprint pointer # print address\n@unsafe # bad idea!\npointer.addr = 0xFFFE # set the address\n\n\nGetting or setting the address of a variable is not supported as a builtin function. However, you can get the address of contents pointed to by the variable structure var\n\nmsgbox\u00a0% &var\n\n\nAxe supports getting the address of a variable using the degree symbol:\n\n.B now contains the address of A\n\nAxe does not support setting the address of a variable directly. However, it does support setting the value of a variable and then dereferencing it:\n\n\nThis should usually be avoided because TI-OS does not use virtual memory. Writing to arbitrary memory locations can affect the stability of the operating system.\n\n\nMany BASICs, especially older flavors like QuickBASIC, lack the ability to set a variable's address (and indeed, they pretty much all lack the ability to work with pointers in any fashion).\n\n'get a variable's address:\ny = VARPTR(x)\n'can't set the address, but can access a given memory location... 1 byte at a time\nz = PEEK(y)\nz = z + (PEEK(y) * 256)\n\n\nThe original BBC BASIC doesn't provide an address-of operator, but BBC BASIC for Windows does:\n\nREM get a variable's address:\ny% = ^x%\nREM can't set a variable's address, but can access a given memory location (4 bytes):\nx% =\u00a0!y%\n\nWith BBC BASIC on other platforms the address of a variable can be found by calling a short piece of machine code, see BeebWiki.\n\n\nUse of pointers in C# is restricted to unsafe sections of code, which is enabled in Microsoft's C# compiler with the commandline parameter /unsafe or in Mono's C# compiler with -unsafe (or --unsafe in older versions).\n\nGet the address[edit]\n\nNote that void* is a \"pure\" address which doesn't carry the type information anymore. If you need the type information (e.g. to recover the variable itself in a type safe manner), use a pointer to the appropriate type instead; in this case int*.\n\nint i = 5;\nvoid* address_of_i = &i;\n\nC / C++[edit]\n\nWorks with: gcc\nWorks with: g++\n\nGet the address[edit]\n\n\nint i;\nvoid* address_of_i = &i;\n\nC++ only: C++ allows overloading the & operator. To bypass this, for example in generic code, use the library function addressof:\n\n#include <memory>\nint i;\nauto address_of_i = std::addressof(i);\n\nSet the address[edit]\n\nWhile C++ doesn't directly support putting a variable at a given address, the same effect can be achieved by creating a reference to that address:\n\nint& i = *(int*)0xA100;\n\nIf the type of the variable requires initialization, it is necessary to use placement new:\n\n#include <new>\nstruct S { int i = 0; S() {} };\nauto& s = *new (reinterpret_cast<void*>(0xa100)) S;\n\nOverlaying of variables is done with anonymous unions; however at global/namespace scope such variables have to be static (i.e. local to the current file):\n\nstatic union\nint i;\nint j;\n\nC++ only: An alternative (and cleaner) solution is to use references:\n\nint i;\nint& j = i;\n\nNote that in this case, the variables can be non-static.\n\nIf the type of two overlaid variables is not sufficiently similar, then writes to one may not be reflected in reads from the other, even though they have the same address. This is because the optimizer is free to assume that variables of different types do not alias. To read or write a variable as a different type, use memcpy:\n\n#include <cstring>\ninline float read_as_float(int const& i) { float f; memcpy(&f, &i, sizeof(f)); return f; }\nint i = 0x0a112233;\nfloat f = read_as_float(i);\n\n\nPointers were added in COBOL 2002.\n\nGet Address[edit]\n\ndata division.\nworking-storage section.\n01 ptr usage pointer.\n01 var pic x(64).\nprocedure division.\nset ptr to address of var.\n\nSet Address[edit]\n\nSets the address of a variable using the BASED clause. There are other methods, in particular LINKAGE SECTION variables.\n\nOCOBOL*> Rosetta Code set address example\n*> tectonics: cobc -x setaddr.cob && ./setaddr\nprogram-id. setaddr.\ndata division.\nworking-storage section.\n01 prealloc pic x(8) value 'somedata'.\n01 var pic x(8) based.\nprocedure division.\nset address of var to address of prealloc\ndisplay var end-display\nend program setaddr.\n\nCommon Lisp[edit]\n\nSimulated Address of Variable[edit]\n\nCommon Lisp has no means to take a simple address reference to a place (the Lisp term for any one of many types of assignable storage locations). For instance, to access the slot of a structure, we need the structure itself (which is essentially a pointer) and a symbol denoting the slot name. To access an array, we need that array object, and an index. To access a local variable, we need the closure object, which is only accessible to code within the lexical scope, which is a long-winded way of saying, we can only access a variable via an expression which is in the lexical scope of the variable.\n\nYet, thanks to Lisp macros and lexical closures, we can create reference values which behave like address of places. A tiny module for doing this is found in Lisppaste #71952 (now it's available here), required by the following example:\n\n;;; Demonstration of references by swapping two variables using a function rather than a macro\n;;; Needs\n(defun swap (ref-left ref-right)\n;; without with-refs we would have to write this:\n;; (psetf (deref ref-left) (deref ref-right)\n;; (deref ref-right) (deref ref-left))\n(with-refs ((l ref-left) (r ref-right))\n(psetf l r r l)))\n(defvar *x* 42)\n(defvar *y* 0)\n(swap (ref *x*) (ref *y*))\n;; *y* -> 42\n;; *x* -> 0\n\nThese references are completely safe to use. There is no way that a place can disappear, leaving a reference dangling, because if a reference is a live object, it prevents the object which contains the referenced place from becoming garbage. Also note that if two references are taken to the same memory location, they are two distinct objects. A function could be provided to test two references for referential equality (do they point to the same object).\n\nVarible-Like Moniker for External Location[edit]\n\nWorks with: CLISP\nWorks with: Linux\nWorks with: Cygwin\n\nWhat does it mean to \"set the address of a variable?\" One interpretation of this task is: rather than let the programming language compiler or run-time allocate a named storage location in its usual ways, force the allocation of a variable at some particular memory location, such as a hardware register, or a variable in a foreign library. Lisp implementations have foreign function interfaces for doing this sort of thing.\n\nHere is an example specific to CLISP running on either Linux or Cygwin. It creates a Lisp errno variable which is located in the C Library's errno.

ERRE data types is 2 bytes-long for integer, 4 (5 with C-64) for reals and 8 for double-real variables. Using this address you can modify the variable's value without using an assignment statement:\n\nPRINT(A%) \u00a0! prints 100\nPRINT(A%) \u00a0! prints 200\n\nNote: With C-64 substitute POKE(ADDR,200) with POKE(ADDR+3,200).\n\n\nUnlike in other BASICs, pointers are readily available in FBSL in several ways although C-style pointer arithmetics is not supported.\n\n1. A simple Variant variable may be dereferenced to point to any other FBSL entity from simple variables through arrays to class instances and COM objects with a ReferenceOf operator, e.g.\n\n   ReferenceOf a = b\n\nwhereby a is set to refer to the variable b.\n\n2. Non-function entities' pointers can be both retrieved and set using a PointerOf operator which also has a shorthand alias @, e.g.\n\n   @a = @b\n\nwhereby a is set to refer to the variable b. Assignment through the PointerOf operator also accepts integer literals to set the variable's absolute address to.\n\n3. Function pointers can be both retrieved and set using an AddressOf operator as in the following sample script. Assignment via AddressOf also accepts integer literals to set a function pointer to an absolute address.\n\n   SUB Foo()\n       PRINT \"foo\"\n   SUB Bar()\n       PRINT \"bar\"\n   Foo() // prints \"bar\" to the console\n\n4. Values at an absolute address or address read by a PointerOf operator plus a byte offset can be retrieved or set using the Peek()/Poke() and GetMem()/SetMem() functions.\n\n\nVariables and created memory blocks return their address when referenced. The \"fetch\" operator @ could also be pronounced \"dereference\".\n\nvariable foo\nfoo .  \\ some large number, an address\n8 foo\u00a0!\nfoo @ .  \\ 8\n\nYou can define a constant or value with an address, which then acts like a variable. This can be used to refer to fixed addresses (such as I/O ports), graphics buffers, or allocated memory.\n\n$3F8 constant LPT1:\n8 LPT1:\u00a0!\n100 cells allocate throw value buffer\n42 buffer 20 cells +\u00a0!\n\n\nWorks with: Fortran version 90 and later\nprogram test_loc\nimplicit none\ninteger :: i\nreal :: r\ni = loc (r)\nwrite (*, '(i0)') i\nend program test_loc\n\nNote: loc is a common extension that is implemented by e.g. the Intel Fortran Compiler, G95 and gfortran.\n\n\nOne can get the address of a variable using the @ operator:\n\n' FB 1.05.0 Win64\nDim a As Integer = 3\nDim p As Integer Ptr = @a\nPrint a, p\n\nTo my knowledge, it is not possible to set the address of a variable to a specific address in FB though (as in C/C++) you can do something like this as a workaround:\n\nVar p = Cast(Integer Ptr, 1375832)\n*p = 42\nPrint p, *p\n\n\ninclude \"ConsoleWindow\"\ndim as short i\u00a0: i = 575\ndim as ptr j\u00a0: j = NULL\nj = @i\nprint \"Adddress of i =\"; j\nprint \"Value of i =\"; [j]\n\n\nAdddress of i = 902164\nValue of i = 575\n\n\nGo has pointers. Just like in C, you can \"take the address\" of an addressable value by using the & operator, and access the value pointed to by a pointer using the * operator.\n\nUnlike in C, pointers are not readily convertible to integers and there is no direct pointer arithmetic. You may print out the address of a pointer, either using the Print function on the pointer, or using the %p format specifier in formatted output (just like in C).\n\nWhen rarely required, you can convert a pointer to an integer using the unsafe package.\n\nIt is not possible in Go to set the address of a variable, however you can assign an arbitrary value to a pointer and use/deference that pointer.\n\nThe following demonstrates getting the address of a variable and storing/printing it various ways. It also demonstrates accessing an arbitrary memory location (here the known address of a float) as an integer.\n\npackage main\nimport (\nfunc main() {\nmyVar := 3.14\nmyPointer := &myVar\nfmt.Println(\"Address:\", myPointer, &myVar)\nfmt.Printf(\"Address:\u00a0%p\u00a0%p\\n\", myPointer, &myVar)\nvar addr64 int64\nvar addr32 int32\nptr := unsafe.Pointer(myPointer)\nif unsafe.Sizeof(ptr) <= unsafe.Sizeof(addr64) {\naddr64 = int64(uintptr(ptr))\nfmt.Printf(\"Pointer stored in int64:\u00a0%#016x\\n\", addr64)\nif unsafe.Sizeof(ptr) <= unsafe.Sizeof(addr32) {\n// Only runs on architectures where a pointer is <= 32 bits\naddr32 = int32(uintptr(ptr))\nfmt.Printf(\"Pointer stored in int32:\u00a0%#08x\\n\", addr32)\naddr := uintptr(ptr)\nfmt.Printf(\"Pointer stored in uintptr:\u00a0%#08x\\n\", addr)\nfmt.Println(\"value as float:\", myVar)\ni := (*int32)(unsafe.Pointer(&myVar))\nfmt.Printf(\"value as int32:\u00a0%#08x\\n\", *i)\n\nOn a 32\u00a0bit architecture:\n\nAddress: 0x3826c020 0x3826c020\nAddress: 0x3826c020 0x3826c020\nPointer stored in   int64: 0x000000003826c020\nPointer stored in   int32: 0x3826c020\nPointer stored in uintptr: 0x3826c020\nvalue as float: 3.14\nvalue as int32: 0x51eb851f\n\nOn a 64 bit architecture:\n\nAddress: 0xc208000170 0xc208000170\nAddress: 0xc208000170 0xc208000170\nPointer stored in   int64: 0x000000c208000170\nPointer stored in uintptr: 0xc208000170\nvalue as float: 3.14\nvalue as int32: 0x51eb851f\n\n\n== Get ==\nThere are at least three ways to get the address of a variable in IWBASIC. The first is to use the address of operator:\n'This will print in the console window (after OPENCONSOLE is issued.)\n'To Print in an open window the appropriate Window variable is specified, e.g., PRINT Win,&X.\nThe second is to use a pointer:\nThe third is to use the Windows API function Lstrcpy. That is done in the same way as the Creative Basic example;\nhowever, the function would be declared as follows: DECLARE IMPORT,Lstrcpy(P1:POINTER,P2:POINTER),INT.\n== Set ==\nIt appears to the author that the closest one can come to being able to assign an address to a variable is to set\nwhich bytes will be used to store a variable in a block of reserved memory:\npMem += 100\n\n\nJ hides the details of pointers and memory allocation from the programmer, so it is rarely, if ever, necessary to do this. However, for those times when there is no better substitute, J provides access to these low-level details:\n\n   var      =: 52                NB.  Any variable (including data, functions, operators etc)\nvar_addr =: 15!:6<'var' NB. Get address\nnew_var =: 15!:7 var_addr NB. Set address\n\n\nThere is no way to access addresses of variables in Java. However, the default hashCode() method defined in the Object class, \"is typically implemented by converting the internal address of the object into an integer\". Therefore, in some Java implementations at least, the hash code returned by Object.hashCode() reflects at least part of the address of an object. For objects whose classes have overridden the hashCode() method, you can still access the original hash code through the System.identityHashCode() function.\n\n\nJulia provides a variety of ways to work with and manipulate raw address pointers (via the built-in Ptr type), which are mostly used in practice for calling C library functions.\n\nTo get the memory address of a Julia object, one can use pointer_from_objref(object), and the reverse is accomplished by unsafe_pointer_to_objref(ptr):\njulia> x = 3\njulia> ptr = pointer_from_objref(x)\nPtr{Void} @0x000000010282e4a0\njulia> unsafe_pointer_to_objref(ptr)\nThe latter is \"unsafe\" because it only works if ptr refers to a valid heap-allocated \"boxed\" Julia object, which can only be safely allocated by Julia itself.\n\nAnother common use of pointers is for arrays of values, which are typically passed in low-level C-like libraries via pointers to contiguous sets of values in memory. This is accomplished in Julia by the pointer(A) function, which returns a pointer to the data stored in a high-level Julia array A. Given a pointer p to values of a given type, the i-th value (numbered starting at 1 for the value pointed to by p) can be read or written by the low-level unsafe_load(p, i) and unsafe_store!(p, val, i) functions, or it can be converted back to a high-level Julia array type by the pointer_to_array(p, dimensions) function:\n\njulia> A = [1, 2.3, 4]\n3-element Array{Float64,1}:\njulia> p = pointer(A)\nPtr{Float64} @0x0000000113f70d60\njulia> unsafe_load(p, 3)\njulia> unsafe_store!(p, 3.14159, 3)\njulia> A\n3-element Array{Float64,1}:\njulia> pointer_to_array(p, (3,))\n3-element Array{Float64,1}:\nFinally, an arbitrary integer can be converted to a pointer type with convert, which allows an arbitrary address to be converted into and viewed as an array of an arbitrary type and read or written (although this can easily result in a crash if an invalid address is used). In the following example, we create a \"new\" length-two array B at an address offset by 8 bytes from the address of the data in A above, which will make it point to the second element of A:\njulia> q = convert(Ptr{Float64}, 0x0000000113f70d68)\nPtr{Float64} @0x0000000113f70d68\njulia> B = pointer_to_array(q, (2,))\n2-element Array{Float64,1}:\n\n\nKotlin/JVM does not support pointers and so (apart from some jiggery-pokery with the sun.misc.Unsafe class) there is no way to obtain a variable's address.\n\nHowever, Kotlin/Native which is currently (January 2018) available as a pre-release version does support pointers to enable it to interoperate with C code. The following program shows how to obtain the address of a variable which has been allocated on the native heap. It does not appear to be possible to allocate a variable at a particular address.\n\nWorks with: Ubuntu version 14.04\n// Kotlin Native v0.5\nimport kotlinx.cinterop.*\nfun main(args: Array<String>) {\nval intVar = nativeHeap.alloc<IntVar>()\nintVar.value = 42\nwith(intVar) { println(\"Value is $value, address is $rawPtr\") }\n\nSample output:\n\nValue is 42, address is 0xc149f0\n\n\nTo obtain the address of any expression in Maple, use the builtin function addressof.\n\n> addressof( x );             \nThe inverse operation is pointto:\n> pointto( 18446884674469911422 );\nThis works for any expression, not just variables:\n> addressof( sin( x )^2 + cos( x )^2 );\n> pointto( 18446884674469972158 );\n2 2\nsin(x) + cos(x)\n\n\nGet Address[edit]\n\nMODULE  GetAddress;\nFROM InOut IMPORT WriteInt, WriteLn;\nadr : LONGINT;\nadr := ADR(var); (*get the address*)\nWriteInt(adr, 0);\nEND GetAddress.\n\nSet Address[edit]\n\nMODULE  SetAddress;\nCONST adress = 134664460;\nVAR var [adress] : INTEGER;\n(*do nothing*)\nEND SetAddress.\n\n\nGet Address[edit]\n\n(set 'a '(1 2 3))\n(address a)\n\n\nvar x = 12\nvar xptr = addr(x) # Get address of variable\necho cast[int](xptr) # and print it\nxptr = cast[ptr int](0xFFFE) # Set the address\n\n\nGet Address[edit]\n\n\nb\u00a0:= 10;\na\u00a0:= SYSTEM.ADR(b); (* Sets variable a to the address of variable b *)\n\nSet Address[edit]\n\nSYSTEM.PUT(a, b); (* Sets the address of b to the address of a *)\n\n\nOCaml is a high-level programming language, and thus does not expose the addresses of variables to the programmer.\n\nHowever, it is kind of possible to get the address of the structure pointed to by a reference type. At runtime, every value in OCaml is a pointer to a \"block\" structure (i.e. boxed) except for int (and things that can fit inside an int, like char, bool, None, datatypes with all no-arg constructors, etc.) which is a direct value (unboxed). For boxed types, it is possible to get this address by some tricky hacks.\n\nAn OCaml value is distinguished between an unboxed integer and a boxed type by the last (least significant) bit. If the bit is set (1), then the value is an integer, and the rest of the bits are the bits of the integer, shifted one bit to the left (that's why int in OCaml can only represent 31 bits in 32-bit, and 63 bits in 64-bit). If the last bit is cleared (0), then the value is a pointer, and all the bits (including the last one) form the address.\n\nTo get the address, we re-interpret the boxed value as an integer; however, this will get the address divided by 2, since the integer only uses the upper 31 (or 63) bits. Therefore, we need to shift this number left by one to get the real address. However, int cannot hold all the bits of the address, so if we shift we will lose a bit, so we use the nativeint type to represent it instead:\n\nlet address_of (x:'a) : nativeint =\nif Obj.is_block (Obj.repr x) then\nNativeint.shift_left (Nativeint.of_int (Obj.magic x)) 1 (* magic *)\ninvalid_arg \"Can only find address of boxed values.\";;\nlet () =\nlet a = 3.14 in\nPrintf.printf \"%nx\\n\" (address_of a);;\nlet b = ref 42 in\nPrintf.printf \"%nx\\n\" (address_of b);;\nlet c = 17 in\nPrintf.printf \"%nx\\n\" (address_of c);; (* error, because int is unboxed *)\n\n\nOtus Lisp has no means to take a simple address reference to a place (the Lisp term for any one of many types of assignable storage locations). It can be done only using the extension mechanism (ffi), but in any case this information can't be useful due to Garbage Collection (at any time the variable can be moved to other place that automatically makes invalid the got reference pointer).\n\n\nooRexx is a high-level programming language, and thus does not expose the addresses of variables to the programmer. Variables can be accessed by name using the VAR(), SYMBOL(), and VALUE() built-in functions.\n\n\nIn Oforth, addresses are not exposed.\n\nVariables (like all Oforth metamodel) are objects. It is possible to retrieve the object corresponding to a variable and use #at and #put to change its value.\n\nFor instance, here, after creating and setting a variable A, we store the corresponding word into a variable B\u00a0:\n\ntvar: A\n10 to A\ntvar: B\n#A to B\nB .s\n[1] (Variable) #A\n12 B put\nA .s\n[1] (Integer) 12\n[2] (Variable) #A\n\n\n\nint a=1,b=2,c=3\nprint \"Adrress of b: \" @b\n\n\nint *aa,*bb,*cc\n\n@[email\u00a0protected] 'setting address of bb to address of b\n\nprint \"Value of bb: \" bb 'result: 2\n\n\n== Get ==\ndim a\nprint adr(a)\n== Set ==\nWhether Panoramic is able to set the value of a variable may depend on what is meant by that. Panoramic implements the\npoke command to set a byte from a value of 0 to 255 (inclusive). Panoramic also implements the peek command to get\nthe value of a byte, so it is possible to the following:\ndim a\nrem a variable with no post-fix is a real.\npoke adr(a),57\nrem the value of a variable being set by setting an address, the address of a in this instance.\ndim a%,b%\nrem\u00a0% means integer.\npoke adr(a%),b%\nrem b% being assigned to the address of a%, in this instance.\nrem it is even possible to free b%\nfree b%\nprint a%\ndim a,b\npoke adr(a),b\nprint b\nrem the address of b being, in effect, set to the address of a, the address of a, in this instance.\nrem Observations and further insight welcome.\n''Note:'' An attempt to poke a real or an integer (Panoramic's only numeric types) value of less than 0 or of more than\n255 will cause an error.\n\n\nIn GP you can sent the address to built-in commands like issquare\n\nissquare(n, &m)\n\nbut you cannot directly compute with it. You can view the address of a variable and other debugging information with the\n\n\n\nIn PARI you can use standard C commands.\n\n\nSee Delphi\n\n\nTo get the address, get the reference to a variable, and either stringify it, or use Scalar::Util's refaddr() to get just the address. Also see Devel::Peek.\n\nuse Scalar::Util qw(refaddr);\nprint refaddr(\\my $v), \"\\n\"; # 135691508\n\nUse Devel::Pointer::PP if you want to dereference a certain address in memory.\n\nChanging the address of a variable is not easily possible, but see perlapi. Wanting to go against the automatic memory management is a sign that this is only used to hack around the deficiencies of dafter languages. I can imagine address munging is commonly used to make variable aliasing possible, but Perl already has a higher level syntax for that.\n\nSimple reference (address) manipulation.\n\nmy $a = 12;\nmy $b = \\$a; # get reference\n$$b = $$b + 30; # access referenced value\nprint $a; # prints 42\n\nExample how to make variable overlay.\n\nmy $a = 12;\nour $b; # you can overlay only global variables (this line is only for strictness)\n*b = \\$a;\nprint $b; # prints 12\nprint $a; # prints 13\n\nPerl 6[edit]\n\nWorks with: Rakudo version 2015.12\nmy $x;\nsay $x.WHERE;\nmy $y := $x; # alias\nsay $y.WHERE; # same address as $x\nsay \"Same variable\" if $y =:= $x;\n$x = 42;\nsay $y; # 42\n\nHow you set the address of a variable (or any other object) is outside the purview of the Perl\u00a06 language, but Perl\u00a06 supports pluggable object representations, and any given representation scheme could conceivably allow an existing address to be treated as an object candidate where that makes sense. Memory-mapped structs are not unreasonable and are likely to be supported on VMs that allow it.\n\n\nPhix does not natively support pointers, but there are methods to do whatever you need.\nYou cannot set the address of a variable, but you can save it and use that to modify things.\nThings get more complicated for floats/strings/sequences, particularly wrt reference counts, but there are examples aplently, for pretty much everything, in the builtins/VM sources. Since all hll variables are dword-aligned or better, a shr 2 loses no information and the result can be safely stored in an integer, avoiding some nasty int/float conversions for anything above #3FFFFFFF (on 32 bit, add another 8Fs on 64 bit). Obviously extreme caution must be exercised, in the example below if you save the address of V which is local to the address() procedure, and then exit said, you have a pointer to memory that will be re-used for something completely different almost immediately. Example is 32 and 64 bit compatible, which at this level needs twice the code, however the compiler only omits the appropriate binary for the currently selected target architecture. You can also use allocate/free with peek/poke to obtain similar effects.\n\nprocedure address()\nobject V\ninteger addr4 -- stored /4 (assuming dword aligned, which it will be)\nlea eax,[V]\nshr eax,2\nmov [addr4],eax\nlea rax,[V]\nshr rax,2\nmov [addr4],rax\nif machine_bits()=32 then\nelsif machine_bits()=64 then\nend if\nif getc(0) then end if\nend procedure\n\n\nThe PicoLisp function 'adr' returns the address of a variable. A variable may be either a symbol or a cons pair in PicoLisp.\n\nThe returned address is a number representing an encoded pointer. For symbols, it is a negative number, and for cons pairs a positive number. The same function 'adr' can then be used to convert that pointer back to the original object.\n\n: (setq X 7)\n-> 7\n: (adr 'X)\n-> -2985527269106\n: (val (adr -2985527269106))\n-> 7\n: (set (adr -2985527269106) '(a b c))\n-> (a b c)\n: X\n-> (a b c)\n\n\ndeclare addr builtin; /* retrieve address of a variable */\ndeclare ptradd builtin; /* pointer addition */\ndeclare cstg builtin; /* retrieve length of the storage of a variable */\ndeclare hbound builtin; /* retrieve the number of elements in an array */\ndeclare p pointer;\ndeclare i bin fixed(31) init(42);\np = addr(i); /* Obtain address of variable, stored in integer variable k */\n/* how to read a string bit by bit - example for pointerAdd */\n/* we built a pointer (movingPointer), which will move through the */\n/* storage of a variable (exampleTxt). attached to the pointer is */\n/* an array of bits (movingBit) - this means wherever the pointer */\n/* is pointing to, this will also be the position of the array. */\n/* only whole bytes can be addressed. to get down to the single bits, */\n/* an array of 8 bits is used. */\ndeclare exampleTxt char(16) init('Hello MainFrame!);\ndeclare movingPointer pointer;\ndeclare movingBit(8) bit(01) based(movingPointer);\ndeclare walkOffset bin fixed(31);\ndeclare walkBit bin fixed(31);\ndo walkOffset = 0 to cstg(exampleTxt)-1;\nmovingPointer = ptradd(addr(exampleTxt, walkOffset);\ndo walkBit = 1 to hbound(movingBit);\nput skip list( 'bit at Byte ' \u00a0!!walkOffset\n\u00a0!!' and position '!!walkBit\n\u00a0!!' is ' \u00a0!!movingBit(walkBit));\n\n\n'get a variable's address:\ny = VARPTR(x)\n'can't set the address of a single variable, but can access memory locations\n'or can do it one byte at a time\nzz(0) = PEEK(BYTE, y)\nzz(1) = PEEK(BYTE, y + 1)\n'(MAK creates an INTEGER, LONG, or QUAD out of the next smaller type)\nz = MAK(INTEGER, zz(0), zz(1))\n'*can* set the address of an array\nDIM zzz(1) AS BYTE AT y\n'zzz(0) = low byte of x, zzz(1) = high byte of x\n\n\nGet the address of a variable using the '@' operator.\n\na.i = 5\n\nSet the address of a structured pointer.

New versions of Python support a ctypes module which permits some low level address operations on C-type objects (see C-types Reference for details).\n\nThe Python id() function returns a unique ID for any object. This just happens to be implemented as the base address of the object in C Python[2]; but that is not guaranteed by the semantics of the language and should not be considered a standard, nor used as such. But for comparison purposes the ID can be used as an address, since different extant objects will have different IDs.\n\nfoo = object()  # Create (instantiate) an empty object\naddress = id(foo)\n\nIn addition some folks have written binary Python modules which implement \"peek\" and \"poke\" operations, but these are non-standard.\n\n\n#lang racket\n(require ffi/unsafe)\n(define (madness v)\u00a0; i'm so sorry\n(cast v _racket _gcpointer))\n\nTo test that it is doing \"sane\" things, you can retrieve the value of the C short located at the pointer produced. Racket objects start with a 2-byte tag indicating their type. These calls should all produce fairly small numbers: the Racket source I'm looking at uses only the first 259 tag values. Small fixnums are stored directly in tagged pointers, so attempting this dereferencing on the pointer madness gives you from a fixnum will most likely segfault your process.\n\n(ptr-ref (madness +) _short)\n(ptr-ref (madness (/ 4 3)) _short)\n(ptr-ref (madness 3.2) _short)\n(ptr-ref (madness (sqrt -2)) _short)\n(ptr-ref (madness #\\a) _short)\n(ptr-ref (madness 'foo) _short)\n\n\nDim TheAddress as long\nDim SecVar as byte\nDim MyVar as byte\nMyVar = 10\n'Get the address of MyVar\nTheAddress = varptr(MyVar)\n'Set a new value on the address\nMEMSET(TheAddress, 102, SizeOf(byte))\n'Myvar is now = 102\nshowmessage \"MyVar = \" + str$(MyVar)\n'...or copy from one address to another using:\nMEMCPY(VarPtr(SecVar), TheAddress, SizeOf(byte))\n'SecVar is now also = 102\nshowmessage \"SecVar = \" + str$(SecVar)\n\n\nRetro is only able to directly access memory as 32-bit values within a linear address space.\n\nGet The Address[edit]\n\nvariable a\n\nSet The Address[edit]\n\nCreate variable b and point it to address 100\n\nvariable b\n100 @last\u00a0!d->xt\n\nByte Addressing[edit]\n\nRetro includes a standard library allowing for creation and access of byte-level data. This is done by creating a pool, which the library functions can then access individual bytes from. The pool has a physical address, which can be set or read, and virtual addresses (starting with zero, and increasing linearly) which are used by the library functions.\n\nTo read the address of the currently active pool:\n\nneeds bad'\n^bad'pool @\n\nOr to set the pool to a specific physical location such as address 100:\n\n100 ^bad'pool\u00a0!\n\n\nREXX has no easy way of getting the address of variables within the langage itself, but since each\nREXX variable can be accessed by name and its name passed to (say) subroutines [PROCEDUREs],\nwith the use of the VALUE and SYMBOL built-in functions (BIFs), it's possible to determine\nthe state of any variable (defined or not defined, its value, length of the variable's value).\n\nIt is possible to use the BIF (shown below)\u00a0 (at least, in the original REXX)\n\nzzz = storage(xxx)\n\n(but only in some REXX interpreters) \u00a0 to access the internal REXX pool of variables, but it\nwould depend on the (internal) REXX internal structure(s) and almost likely be not portable nor\nuseable across releases of REXX or the operating system. \u00a0 It would be necessary to follow a\npretty complex chain of pointers to just find the REXX pool of variables and the internal structure\nmay be pretty complicated and somewhat obscure. \u00a0 Going down this path is not for the faint of\n\n\nYou can't access the address of a \"variable\" in Ruby. However, it may be possible to get the address of an object.\n\nThe Ruby object_id method returns an object ID that is unique among active objects. It turns out that for the official Ruby implementation, the object ID is based on the address. For non-immediate objects (i.e. anything other than a Fixnum, Symbol, true, false, or nil), the address can be obtained by shifting the object ID one to the left. For more information, see the source code for the object_id method:[3].\n\nFor classes that do not override the to_s method, the to_s method also shows the address.\n\n>foo =  # => #<Object:0x10ae32000>\n>id = foo.object_id # => 2238812160\n>\"%x\" % (id << 1) # => \"10ae32000\"\n\n\nIt is not possible to change the memory address of an existing variable in Rust directly. However, you could make a copy of the value and then write it to a specific address.\n\nlet v1 = vec![vec![1,2,3]; 10];\nprintln!(\"Original address: {:p}\", &v1);\nlet mut v2;\n// Override rust protections on reading from uninitialized memory\nunsafe {v2 = mem::uninitialized();}\nlet addr = &mut v2 as *mut _;\n// ptr::write() though it takes v1 by value, v1s destructor is not run when it goes out of\n// scope, which is good since then we'd have a vector of free'd vectors\nunsafe {ptr::write(addr, v1)}\nprintln!(\"New address: {:p}\", &v2);\n\nGet the memory address of a variable:\n\nlet var = 1;\nprintln!(\"address of var: {:p}\", &var);\n\nGet the value at a certain memory address:\n\nlet address: usize = 0x7ffc8f303130;\nunsafe {\nlet val = *(address as *const usize);\nprintln!(\"value at {}: {:?}\", address, val);\n\nSet the value at a certain memory address:\n\nunsafe {\n*(0x7ffc8f303130 as *mut usize) = 1;\n// Note that this invokes undefined behavior if 0x7ffc8f303130 is uninitialized. In that case, std::ptr::write should be used.\nstd::ptr::write(0x7ffc8f303130 as *mut usize, 1);\n\n\nThere is no way to access addresses in Scala. It's governed by the Memory Management of the JVM controlling or knowing the addresses makes absolutely no sense in Scala.\n\n\nvar n = 42;\nsay Sys.refaddr(\\n); # prints the address of the variable\nsay Sys.refaddr(n); # prints the address of the object at which the variable points to\n\n\nThis task does not really make sense in Smalltalk: for one, all we could ask for is the address of an object, not a variable, which is a binding of a name to a value in a lexical scoping (similar to Scheme, Common Lisp and other managed languages). Second, the underlying memory management (garbage collector) is usually free to move objects around, and most implementations do so when objects are tenured or memory areas are defragmented (also similar). So its usefulness is limited to VM developers and debuggers\u00a0;-)\n\nYou asked for it, and here it is:\n\nWorks with: Smalltalk/X\np := Point x:10 y:20.\nObjectMemory addressOf:p.\nObjectMemory collectGarbage.\nObjectMemory addressOf:p \"may return another value\"\n\nto deal with non-Smalltalk objects, all Smalltalks provide libraries to pass-in and out parameters to foreign function calls (FFI). The underlying memory block will not be moved by the garbage collector and the address can be passed to external (eg. C, C++, asm) functions. For those, we can allocate a block of memory and fiddle around with its \"address\":\n\nWorks with: Smalltalk/X\nptr := ExternalBytes new:10.\nptr address.\nptr byteAt:1 put: 16rFF.\n\nHowever, there are \"reference holders\", similar to box-objects in scheme/lisp. In Smalltalk these are called \"ValueHolder\" and are heavily used in UI frameworks. Usually, they are used with the observer pattern as shown in the following example:\n\nholder\u00a0:= ValueHolder with:123.\nholder onChangeSend:#someChange to:someone.\nholder value: 234\n\n\nSee pointers in Stata help. It's not possible to set the address of a variable, but on can get the address of a variable or a function with the & operator.\n\na = 1\nfunction f(x) {\n\n\nclass MyClass { }\nfunc printAddress<T>(of pointer: UnsafePointer<T>) {\nfunc test() {\nvar x = 42\nvar y = 3.14\nvar z = \"foo\"\nvar obj = MyClass()\n// Use a pointer to a variable on the stack and print its address.\nwithUnsafePointer(to: &x) { print($0) }\nwithUnsafePointer(to: &y) { print($0) }\nwithUnsafePointer(to: &z) { print($0) }\nwithUnsafePointer(to: &obj) { print($0) }\n// Alternately:\nprintAddress(of: &x)\nprintAddress(of: &y)\nprintAddress(of: &z)\nprintAddress(of: &obj)\n// Printing the address of an object that an object reference points to.\n\n\nIt is highly unusual to want to directly manipulate the address of a variable in Tcl, as it is a thoroughly unsafe operation. Indeed, Tcl does not expose any mechanism to do so at the script level. However, Tcl does contain a C-level API function, Tcl_LinkVar, to arrange for a variable's value to always reflect the contents of a particular address in memory. (See Machine Address for an example of how to do that.)\n\nHowever, that's not the only way of doing it. You can also use the critcl library to put C code directly inside a Tcl script and so work with addresses directly that way.\n\nLibrary: critcl\npackage require critcl\n# This code assumes an ILP32 architecture, like classic x86 or VAX.\ncritcl::cproc peek {int addr} int {\nunion {\nint i;\nint *a;\n} u;\nu.i = addr;\nreturn *u.a;\ncritcl::cproc poke {int addr int value} void {\nunion {\nint i;\nint *a;\n} u;\nu.i = addr;\n*u.a = value;\npackage provide poker 1.0\n\n\npackage require poker\n# Increment a memory location; this will probably crash if you try for real.\n# We don't define how to get a good address, but it's not usually a problem\n# for embedded programming...\nset where 0x12340\npoke $where [expr {[peek $where] + 1}]\n\nHave great care with this sort of code; the damage you can do by writing to random locations is considerable and being able to read from anywhere could allow information to flow to otherwise unauthorized programs.\n\n\nGet the Address[edit]\n\nThe default behaviour of a data element in Toka is to return its address. This makes obtaining the address trivial:\n\nvariable foo\nfoo .\n\nSet the Address[edit]\n\nYou can manually assign a name to any memory address (or other number), but you should make sure it's part of allocated memory first.\n\n hex abcdef is-data foo\n foo .\n\n\nThe VarPtr function allows one to get the address of a variable. There are also functions to peek/poke values at a given address.\n\nOption Explicit\nDeclare Sub GetMem1 Lib \"msvbvm60\" (ByVal ptr As Long, ByRef x As Byte)\nDeclare Sub GetMem2 Lib \"msvbvm60\" (ByVal ptr As Long, ByRef x As Integer)\nDeclare Sub GetMem4 Lib \"msvbvm60\" (ByVal ptr As Long, ByRef x As Long)\nDeclare Sub PutMem1 Lib \"msvbvm60\" (ByVal ptr As Long, ByVal x As Byte)\nDeclare Sub PutMem2 Lib \"msvbvm60\" (ByVal ptr As Long, ByVal x As Integer)\nDeclare Sub PutMem4 Lib \"msvbvm60\" (ByVal ptr As Long, ByVal x As Long)\nSub Test()\nDim a As Long, ptr As Long, s As Long\na = 12345678\n'Get and print address\nptr = VarPtr(a)\nDebug.Print ptr\nCall GetMem4(ptr, s)\nDebug.Print s\nCall PutMem4(ptr, 87654321)\nDebug.Print a\nEnd Sub\n\nVisual Basic .NET[edit]\n\nVisual Basic uses managed memory that can be moved around at any time.

The address is just a number like any other and you can perform all the arithmetic you like on it. However, there's no way to dereference an address back into a value, so this is not pointer arithmetic. The primary use of addr is to check if two objects are the same and not just copies, like Common Lisp's eq operator.\n\nif (addr.x = addr.y)\n\nAs a result, Wart has only one way to compare values: by default two objects are considered equal if they are structurally isomorphic. (You can override it if you want a different behavior.)\n\nX86 Assembly[edit]\n\nFor SVR4 Unix-like style assembler the address of a variable is its symbol. (On some systems the names of C language variables have an extra leading underscore.)\n\n        movl    my_variable,\u00a0%eax\n\nFor SVR4 style code destined for a shared library it's necessary to fetch the address from the global offset table to ensure position independent code. That table is found relative to the program counter using the special _GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_ (or on some systems extra leading underscore __GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_). The C compiler normally does this in %ebx but for hand-crafted assembler anything equivalent is possible.\n\n        call    eip_to_eax\nmovl [email\u00a0protected](%eax),\u00a0%eax\nmovl (%esp),\u00a0%eax\n\n\nTo get the address in the heap of a variable X, use:\n\n\nIf by \"setting the address\" we mean compelling the system to store a variable at a particular address of our choosing, then there is no easy way to do that.\n\n\nIt is easy to get the address of a variable (relative to the beginning of its data segment), but there is no way to set the address of a variable. However, pointers can be used to access specific addresses. The example shows how the pointer B(0) is used to access the variable A and set it to hex 1234ABCD. The Peek and Poke intrinsics can be used to access specific hardware addresses. The absolute hardware address of a program's data segment can be obtained using the GetReg intrinsic. The '@' operator works exactly like 'addr' for integers but returns a 'real' pointer, instead of a 32-bit relative address, when used on a 'real' variable.\n\ninclude c:\\cxpl\\codes;\nint A, B;\n[B:= addr A;\nHexOut(0, B); CrLf(0);\nB(0):= $1234ABCD;\nHexOut(0, A); CrLf(0);\n\n\nYorick has pointers, but they are typically used in an opaque fashion. Pointer arithmetic is not supported, not is referencing arbitrary memory locations. However, a pointer address may be copied to other variables. Here is an interactive example that illustrates some of this.\n\n> foo = 1\n> bar = &foo\n> bar\n> baz = bar\n> *baz = 5\n> *bar\n> *baz",
    "output": "\n> foo\n\nThe address of foo is returned when bar is printed, and the value of foo changes when baz is set to 5.\n\nThe & operator returns the address of its argument. The * operator dereferences its argument. The & and * operators can also be used to convert to and from references when used in an assignment context. Yorick's references are similar to C pointers, but they are handled differently internally. Unlike in C, it is not possible to perform arithmetic on references. References are also safer to use in Yorick than in C as out-of-bounds references generate errors rather than causing segmentation faults. However, Yorick does not protect against the use of null references, which are simply references to memory addresses that do not correspond to valid Yorick objects. Dereferencing a null reference generates an error.\n\n> foo = 1\n> bar = &foo\n> foo = 0\n> *bar\n*** ERROR: Invalid reference\n> *bar = 5\n*** ERROR: Invalid reference\n\nThe above code creates a reference bar to the foo variable. foo is then set to 0, but the reference is not changed. The reference bar becomes invalid after this assignment, and attempts to read or write through it result in errors. This behavior allows Yorick to safely use references internally in many cases, but it limits their utility in some cases.\n\nYorick also has references to function arguments. Argument references are created by specifying the reference type (ref, in, out, or inout) of a function argument when defining a function. Here is an example that illustrates how to use an argument reference to change the value of a variable when calling a function.\n\n> proc modify_value(inout arg)\n>   arg = arg + 1\n> end\n> foo = 1\n> modify_value(&foo)\n> foo\nSee also[edit]"

    "prompt": "Object Oriented Programming\n\nWhat will we cover?\n\nWhat is Object Oriented Programming?\n\nAlthough the ideas behind Object Oriented Programming were developed in the late 1960's it was not until the 1980's that it became widely known in the programming community with the release of Smalltalk-80 and a variety of Lisp implementations. During the 1980's it remained a curiosity rather than a mainstream concept. It was the popularisation of the graphical user interface or GUI, first on the Apple Mac and later in MS Windows (and X windows in the Unix world) with its windows, buttons and menus that really turned things around. By the end of the millennium, Object Oriented Programming, or OOP, had become the pre-eminent technique for software development.\n\nLanguages like Java, C++ and Python embody the concept so much that you can do very little without coming across objects somewhere. So what's it all about? It is quite a big topic and many books have been written about it. We can only touch on the concepts here but if you would like to dig deeper into the depths\n\nthen the best introductions are, in my opinion:\n\nThese increase in depth, size and academic exactitude as you go down the list. For most non-professional programmers' purposes the first is adequate. None of these are really programming books but also duscuss analysis and design. This is because OOP is best practiced by applying the principles throughout the project lifecycle, it is genuinely a different way of thinking about problems.\n\nAssuming you don't have the time nor the inclination to research all these books and links right now, I'll give you a brief overview of the concept. (Note:Some people find OO hard to grasp others 'get it' right away. Don't worry if you come under the former category, you can still use objects even without really 'seeing the light'. The more you use them the clearer it gets.)\n\nOne final point: it is possible to implement an Object Oriented design in a non OO language through coding conventions, but it's usually an option of last resort rather than a recommended strategy. If your problem fits well with OO techniques then it's best to use an OO language. Most modern languages, including Python, VBScript and JavaScript support OOP quite well. That having been said I will be using Python throughout all the examples and only showing the basic concepts in VBScript and JavaScript with little additional explanation.\n\nData and Function - together\n\nObjects are collections of data and functions that operate on that data. These are bound together so that you can pass an object from one part of your program and they automatically get access to not only the data attributes but the operations that are available too. This combining of data and function is the very essence of Object Oriented Programming and is known as encapsulation. (Some programming languages make the data invisible to users of the object and thus require that the data be accessed via the object's methods. This technique is properly known as data hiding, however in some texts data hiding and encapsulation are used interchangeably.)\n\nAs an example of encapsulation, a string object would store the character string but also provide methods to operate on that string - search, change case, calculate length etc.\n\nObjects use a message passing metaphor whereby one object passes a message to another object and the receiving object responds by executing one of its operations, a method. So a method is invoked on receipt of the corresponding message by the owning object. There are various notations used to represent this but the most common mimics the access to items in modules - a dot. Thus, for a fictitious widget class:\n\nw = Widget() # create new instance, w, of widget\nw.paint()  # send the message 'paint' to it\n\nThis would cause the paint method of the widget object to be invoked.\n\nDefining Classes\n\nJust as data has various types so objects can have different types. These collections of objects with identical characteristics are collectively known as a class. We can define classes and create instances of them, which are the actual objects. We can store references to these objects in variables in our programs.\n\nLet's look at a concrete example to see if we can explain it better. We will create a message class that contains a string - the message text - and a method to print the message.\n\nclass Message:\n    def __init__(self, aString):\n        self.text = aString\n    def printIt(self):\n        print( self.text )\n\nNote 1:One of the methods of this class is called __init__ and it is a special method called a constructor. The reason for the name is that it is called when a new object instance is created or constructed. Any variables assigned (and hence created in Python) inside this method will be unique to the new instance. There are a number of special methods like this in Python, nearly all distinguished by the __xxx__ naming format (and informally known as \"dunder\" methods by the Python community). The exact timing of when a constructor is called varies between languages, in Python init gets called after the instance has actually been created in memory, in other languages the constructor actually returns the instance itself. The difference is sufficiently subtle that you don't usually need to worry about it.\n\nNote 2:Both the methods defined have a first parameter self. The name is a convention but it indicates the object instance. As we will soon see this parameter is filled in by the interpreter at run-time, not by the programmer. Thus printIt is called, on an instance of the class (see below), with no arguments: m.printIt().\n\nNote 3:We called the class Message with a capital 'M'. This is purely convention, but it is fairly widely used, not just in Python but in other OO languages too. A related convention says that method names should begin with a lowercase letter and subsequent words in the name begin with uppercase letters. Thus a method called \"calculate current balance\" would be written: calculateCurrentBalance.\n\nYou may want to briefly revisit the 'Raw Materials' section and look again at 'user defined types'. The Python address example should be a little clearer now. Essentially the only kind of user-defined type in Python is a class. A class with attributes but no methods (except __init__ ) is effectively equivalent to a construct called a record or struct in some programming languages.\n\nA Graphical Notation\n\nThe software engineering community have adopted a graphical notation for describing classes and objects and their relationships to each other. This notation is called the Unified Modelling Language (or UML) and is a powerful design tool. In total UML contains many diagrams and icons but we will only look at a few here that may help you grasp the concepts.\n\nThe first and most important icon we meet in UML is the class description, it consists of a box with three compartments. The top compartment contains the class name, the middle compartment contains the class attributes, or data, and the bottom compartment contains the methods, or functions, of the class.\n\nThe Message class defined above would look like this:\n\nUML Class icon\n\nWe will show other UML icons as we develop the topic and introduce new concepts supported by the notation.\n\nUsing Classes\n\nHaving defined a class we can now create instances of our Message class and manipulate them:\n\nm1 = Message(\"Hello world\")\nm2 = Message(\"So long, it was short but sweet\")\n\nnotes = [m1, m2] # put the objects in a list\nfor msg in notes:\n    msg.printIt() # print each message in turn\n\nSo in essence you just treat the class as if it was a standard Python data type, which was after all the purpose of the exercise!\n\nUML also has an icon for an object or instance. It is the same as the class icon, except we usually leave the bottom two boxes blank. The name is made up of the object or instance name followed by the class name with a colon in between. Thus m1:Message tells us that m1 is an instance of the Message class.\n\nOur message example would be drawn like this:\n\nUML Object diagram\n\nNote that the List class represents the normal Python list type (as indicated by the word builtin being within angle brackets, a construct known as a stereotype in UML). The lines with diamonds indicate that the list contains the Message objects. The MyProg object likewise is stereotyped as being a utility class, which means, in this case, that it does not exist as a class within the program but is a product of the environment. ( Operating system facilities are often shown this way, as are libraries of functions.) The solid lines from myProg to Message indicate that the myProg \"object\" has an association with, or reference to, the Message objects. The arrows adjacent to these lines indicate that the myProg \"object\" sends the printIt message to each of the Message objects. In effect object messages are transmitted via associations.\n\nWhat is \"self\"?\n\nNo, it's not a philosophical debate, it's one of the questions most often asked by new Python OOP programmers. Every method definition in a class in Python starts with a parameter called self. The actual name self is just a convention, but like many programming conventions consistency is good so let's stick with it! (As you'll see later JavaScript has a similar concept but uses the name this instead.)\n\nSo what is self all about? Why do we need it?\n\nBasically self is just a reference to the current instance. When you create an instance of the class the instance contains its own data (as created by the constructor) but not of the methods. Thus when we send a message to an instance and it calls the corresponding method, it does so via an internal reference to the class. It passes a reference to itself (self!) to the method so that the class code knows which instance to use.\n\nLet's look at a relatively familiar example. Consider a GUI application which has lots of Button objects. When a user presses a button the method associated with a button press is activated - but how does the Button method know which of the buttons has been pressed? The answer is by referring to the self value which will be a reference to the actual button instance that was pressed. We'll see this in practice when we get to the GUI topic a little later.\n\nSo what happens when a message is sent to an object? It works like this:\n\nYou can see this in action in this code sequence, notice that we can explicitly call the class method, as we do in the last line:\n\n>>> class C:\n...   def __init__(self, val): self.val = val\n...   def f(self): print \"hello, my value is:\", self.val\n>>> # create two instances\n>>> a = C(27)\n>>> b = C(42)\n>>> # first try sending messages to the instances\n>>> a.f()\nhello, my value is 27\n>>> b.f()\nhello, my value is 42\n>>> # now call the method explicitly via the class\n>>> C.f(a)\nhello, my value is 27\n\nSo you see we can call the methods via the instance, in which case Python fills in the self parameter for us, or explicitly via the class, in which case we need to pass the self value explicitly.\n\nNow you might be wondering why, if Python can provide the invisible reference between the instance and its class can't Python also magically fill in the self by itself? The answer is that Guido van Rossum designed it this way! Many OOP languages do indeed hide the self parameter, but one of the guiding principles of Python is that \"explicit is better than implicit\". You soon get used to it and after a while not doing it seems strange.\n\nSame thing, Different thing\n\nWhat we have so far is the ability to define our own types (classes) and create instances of these and assign them to variables. We can then pass messages to these objects which trigger the methods we have defined. But there's one last element to this OO stuff, and in many ways it's the most important aspect of all.\n\nIf we have two objects of different classes but which support the same set of messages but with their own corresponding methods then we can collect these objects together and treat them identically in our program but the objects will behave differently. This ability to behave differently to the same input messages is known as polymorphism.\n\nTypically this could be used to get a number of different graphics objects to draw themselves on receipt of a 'paint' message. A circle draws a very different shape from a triangle but provided they both have a paint method we, as programmers, can ignore the difference and just think of them as 'shapes'.\n\nLet's look at an example, where instead of drawing shapes we calculate their areas:\n\nFirst we create Square and Circle classes:\n\nclass Square:\n    def __init__(self, side):\n        self.side = side\n    def calculateArea(self):\n        return self.side**2\n\nclass Circle:\n    def __init__(self, radius):\n        self.radius = radius\n    def calculateArea(self):\n        import math\n        return math.pi*(self.radius**2)\n\nNow we can create a list of shapes (either circles or squares) and then print out their areas:\n\nshapes = [Circle(5),Circle(7),Square(9),Circle(3),Square(12)]\n\nfor item in shapes:\n    print \"The area is: \", item.calculateArea()\n\nNow if we combine these ideas with modules we get a very powerful mechanism for reusing code. Put the class definitions in a module - say 'shapes.py' and then simply import that module when we want to manipulate shapes. This is exactly what has been done with many of the standard Python modules, which is why accessing methods of an object looks a lot like using functions in a module.\n\nShape objects\n\nHere we see a more complex object diagram. Notice that in this case the objects within the list do not have names because we did not explicitly create variables for them. In this case we just show a blank before the colon and class name. However, the diagram is starting to get very busy. For this reason we only draw object diagrams when necessary to illustrate some unusual feature of the design. Instead we use more sophisticated features of class diagrams to show the relationships, as we'll see in the examples below.\n\n\nInheritance is often used as a mechanism to implement polymorphism. Indeed in many OO languages it is the only way to implement polymorphism. It works as follows:\n\nA class can inherit both attributes and operations from a parent or super class. This means that a new class which is identical to another class in most respects does not need to re-implement all the methods of the existing class, rather it can inherit those capabilities and then override those that it wants to do differently (like the calculateArea method in the case above)\n\nAgain an example might illustrate this best. We will use a class hierarchy of bank accounts where we can deposit cash, obtain the balance and make a withdrawal. Some of the accounts provide interest (which, for our purposes, we'll assume is calculated on every deposit - an interesting innovation to the banking world!) and others charge fees for withdrawals.\n\nThe BankAccount class\n\nLet's see how that might look. First let's consider the attributes and operations of a bank account at the most general (or abstract) level.\n\nIt's usually best to consider the operations first then provide attributes as needed to support these operations. So for a bank account we can:\n\nTo support these operations we will need a bank account ID (for the transfer operation) and the current balance. In this example, for the ID, we will just use the variable to which we assign the object but, in a real project we would likely create an ID attribute which stored a unique reference. We will also need to store the balance.\n\nIn UML that would look like:\nBankAccount class\n\nWe can now create a class to support that:\n\n# first create a custom exception class\nclass BalanceError(Exception): \n      value = \"Sorry you only have $%6.2f in your account\"\n\nclass BankAccount:\n    def __init__(self, initialAmount):\n       self.balance = initialAmount\n       print( \"Account created with balance %5.2f\" % self.balance )\n\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n       self.balance = self.balance + amount\n\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n       if self.balance >= amount:\n          self.balance = self.balance - amount\n          raise BalanceError()\n\n    def checkBalance(self):\n       return self.balance\n    def transfer(self, amount, account):\n       except BalanceError:\n          print( BalanceError.value % self.balance )\n\nNote 1: We check the balance before withdrawing and also use an exception to handle errors. Of course there is no Python error type BalanceError so we needed to create one of our own - it's simply an subclass of the standard Exception class with a string value. The string value is defined as an attribute of the exception class purely as a convenience, it ensures that we can generate standard error messages every time we raise an error. Notice that we didn't use self when defining the value in BalanceError, that's because value is a shared attribute across all instances, it is defined at the class level and known as a class variable. We access it by using the class name followed by a dot: BalanceError.value as seen above. Now, when the error generates its traceback it concludes by printing out the formatted error string showing the current balance.\n\nNote 2: The transfer method uses the BankAccount's withdraw/deposit member functions or methods to do the transfer. This is very common in OO and is known as self messaging. It means that derived classes can implement their own versions of deposit/withdraw but the transfer method can remain the same for all account types.\n\nOK, now that we have defined our BankAccount as a base class we can get back to inheritance which is what we are supposed to be discussing! Let's look at our first sub class.\n\nThe InterestAccount class\n\nNow we use inheritance to provide an account that adds interest (we'll assume a default of 3%) on every deposit. It will be identical to the standard BankAccount class except for the deposit method and the initialisation of the interest rate. So we simply override those:\n\nclass InterestAccount(BankAccount):\n   def __init__(self, initialAmount, interest=0.03):\n       self.interest = interest\n   def deposit(self, amount):\n       self.balance = self.balance * (1 + self.interest)\n\nNote 1: We pass the super-class (or parent) as a parameter in the class definition. In this case the parent is BankAccount\n\nNote 2: We call the super().__init__) at the beginning of the __init__() method. super() is a special function which works out what the superclass is. This is helpful in cases where we inherit more than one superclass (yes, you can do that too! It's called multiple inheritance and you'll see an example later in this topic) and avoids some obscure issues which can arise if you try calling the superclass by name. So always use super(). By calling the __init__ method of the superclass we get all the initialisation of our inherited class(es) for free. We just need to initialise the new interest attribute that we introduced here. The same applies to the use of super() in the deposit method, it simply calls the parent class' deposit method so that we only need to add the new features of our InterestAccount).\n\nAnd that's it. We begin to see the power of OOP, all the other methods have been inherited from BankAccount (by putting BankAccount inside the parentheses after the new class name). Notice that once again deposit called the super-class's deposit method rather than copying the code. Now if we modify the BankAccount deposit to include some kind of error checking the sub-class will gain those changes automatically.\n\nThe ChargingAccount class\n\nThis account is again identical to a standard BankAccount class except that this time it charges a default fee of $3 for every withdrawal. As for the InterestAccount we can create a class inheriting from BankAccount and, this time, modifying the init and withdraw methods:\n\nclass ChargingAccount(BankAccount):\n    def __init__(self, initialAmount, fee=3):\n        self.fee = fee\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n\nNote 1: We store the fee as an instance variable so that we can change it later if necessary. Notice that we again call the inherited __init__ just like any other method.\n\nNote 2: We simply add the fee to the requested withdrawal in the call to the inherited withdraw method which does all the real work.\n\nNote 3: We introduce a side effect here in that a charge is automatically levied on transfers too, but that's probably what we want, so is OK. But its worth noting that all this reuse does carry a potential penalty of unexpected side-effects which you need to look out for.\n\nIn UML we represent inheritance with a solid arrow pointing from the sub class to the superclass. We can now represent our bank account heirarchy like this:\n\nBankAccount heirarchy\n\nNotice we only list the methods and attributes that have changed or been added in sub classes.\n\nTesting our system\n\nTo check that it all works try executing the following piece of code (either at the Python prompt or by creating a separate test file).\n\nfrom bankaccount import *\n# First a standard BankAccount\na = BankAccount(500)\nb = BankAccount(200)\n# a.withdraw(1000)\nprint( \"A = \", a.checkBalance() )\nprint( \"B = \", b.checkBalance() )\n\n# Now an InterestAccount\nc = InterestAccount(1000)\nprint( \"C = \", c.checkBalance() )\n\n# Then a ChargingAccount\nd = ChargingAccount(300)\nprint( \"D = \", d.checkBalance() )\nprint( \"D = \", d.checkBalance() )\nprint( \"A = \", a.checkBalance() )\nprint( \"D = \", d.checkBalance() )\n\n# Finally transfer from charging account to the interest one\n# The charging one should charge and the interest one add\n# interest\nprint( \"C = \", c.checkBalance() )\nprint( \"D = \", d.checkBalance() )\nprint( \"C = \", c.checkBalance() )\nprint( \"D = \", d.checkBalance() )\n\nNow uncomment the line a.withdraw(1000) to see the exception at work.\n\nThat's it. A reasonably straightforward example but it shows how inheritance can be used to quickly extend a basic framework with powerful new features.\n\nWe've seen how we can build up the example in stages and how we can put together a test program to check it works. Our tests were not complete in that we didn't cover every case and there are more checks we could have included - like what to do if an account is created with a negative amount...\n\nTest Driven Development\n\nMany professional programmers use a technique known as Test Driven Development (TDD) in which they write their tests before they write their code. This may initially sound bizarre but it allows them to test their code repeatedly as they develop it and move from a state where every test fails to one where every test passes. At that point their program should work properly!\n\nSo popular is this that special tools have been developed to assist with this approach. Python has several such tools including the unittest module that is in the standard library. TDD is a good approach when writing serious code however in the context of a tutorial it would simply hide the main code that we are trying to study amongst a mass of test cases so I won't be using it here. But its a concept we look at in more detail in a later topic.\n\nCollections of Objects\n\nOne problem that might have occurred to you is how we deal with lots of objects. Or how to manage objects which we create at runtime. It's all very well creating bank accounts statically as we did above:\n\nacc1 = BankAccount(...)\nacc2 = BankAccount(...)\nacc3 = BankAccount(...)\n\nBut in the real world we don't know in advance how many accounts we need to create. How do we deal with this? Let's consider the problem in more detail:\n\nWe need some kind of 'database' that allows us to find a given bank account by its owners name (or more likely their bank account number - since one person can have many accounts and several persons can have the same name...)\n\nFinding something in a collection given a unique key....hmmm, sounds like a dictionary! Let's see how we'd use a Python dictionary to hold dynamically created objects:\n\nfrom bankaccount import BankAccount\nimport time\n\n# Create new function to generate unique id numbers\ndef getNextID():\n    ok = input(\"Create account[y/n]? \")\n    if ok[0] in 'yY':  # check valid input\n       id = time.time() # use current time as basis of ID\n       id = int(id) % 10000 # convert to int and shorten to 4 digits\n    else: id = -1  # which will stop the loop\n    return id\n# Let's create some accounts and store them in a dictionary\naccountData = {}  # new dictionary\nwhile True:          # loop forever\n   id = getNextID()\n   if id == -1: \n      break       # break forces an exit from the while loop\n   bal = float(input(\"Opening Balance? \"))  # convert string to float  \n   accountData[id] = BankAccount(bal) # use id to create new dictionary entry\n   print( \"New account created, Number: %04d, Balance %0.2f\" % (id, bal) )\n\n# Now let's access the accounts\nfor id in accountData.keys():\n    print( \"%04d\\t%0.2f\" % (id, accountData[id].checkBalance()) )\n\n# and find a particular one\n# Enter non-number to force exception and end program\nwhile True:\n   id = int(input(\"Which account number? \"))\n   if id in accountData:\n      print( \"Balance = %0.2d\" % accountData[id].checkBalance() )\n   else: print( \"Invalid ID\" )\n\nOf course the key you use for the dictionary can be anything that uniquely identifies the object, it could be one of its attributes, like balance say (except that balance would not be a very good unique key!). Anything at all that is unique. You might find it worthwhile going back to the raw materials chapter and reading the dictionary section again, they really are very useful containers.\n\nWe can represent that graphically in UML using a class diagram. The dictionary is shown as a class which has a relationship with many BankAccounts. This is shown by the asterisk on the line connecting the classes. An asterisk is used because that is the symbol used in regular expressions to indicate zero or more items. This is known as the cardinality of the relationship and can be shown in a number of ways but the regular expression numeric ranges are quite commonly used because of their richness and flexibility.\n\nCollection of classes\n\nNotice the use of a stereotype on the Dictonary to show it is a built-in class. Notice also the box attached to the association showing that the key is the ID value. If we had been using a simple list we would not have had the box and the line would have directly connected the two classes. This use of class relationships and cardinality is how we avoid the need for very large complex Object diagrams. We can focus on the abstract relationships between classes rather than the myriad of physical relationships between individual instances.\n\nSaving Your Objects\n\nOne snag with all of this is that you lose your data when the program ends. You need some way of saving objects too. As you get more advanced you will learn how to use databases to do that but we will look at using a simple text file to save and retrieve objects. If you are using Python there are a couple of modules (called pickle and shelve) that do this much more effectively but as usual I'll try to show you the generic way to do it that will work in any language. Incidentally the technical term for the ability to save and restore objects is Persistence.\n\nThe generic way to do this is to create save and restore methods at the highest level object and override in each class, such that they call the inherited version and then add their locally defined attributes:\n\nclass A:\n   def __init__(self,x,y):\n     self.x = x\n     self.y = y\n     self.f = None\n\n   def save(self,fn):\n     f = open(fn,\"w\")\n     f.write(str(self.x)+ '\\n') # convert to a string and add newline\n     return f             # for child objects to use\n\n   def restore(self, fn):\n     f = open(fn)\n     self.x = int(f.readline()) # convert back to original type\n     self.y = int(f.readline())\n     return f\nclass B(A):\n   def __init__(self,x,y,z):\n     self.z = z\n   def save(self,fn):\n     f = super().save(fn)  # call parent save\n     return f         # in case further children exist\n   def restore(self, fn):\n     f = super().restore(fn)\n     self.z = int(f.readline())\n     return f\n\n# create instances\na = A(1,2)\nb = B(3,4,5)\n\n# save the instances\na.save('a.txt').close() # remember to close the file\n\n# retrieve instances\nnewA = A(5,6)\nnewA.restore('a.txt').close() # remember to close the file\nnewB = B(7,8,9)\nprint( \"A: \",newA.x,newA.y )\nprint( \"B: \",newB.x,newB.y,newB.z )\n\nNote: The values printed out are the restored values not the ones we used to create the instances.\n\nThe key thing is to override the save/restore methods in each class and to call the parent method as the first step. Then in the child class only deal with child class attributes. Obviously how you turn an attribute into a string and save it is up to you the programmer but it must be output on a single line. When restoring you simply reverse the storing process.\n\nOne big snag with this approach is that you need to create a separate file for each object. In a real world example that could mean thousands of very small files. This quickly gets cumbersome and so using a database to store the objects becomes necessary. We will look at how to do that in a later topic, but the basic principles remain the same.\n\nMixing Classes and Modules\n\nModules and classes both provide mechanisms for controlling the complexity of a program. It seems reasonable that as programs get bigger we would want to combine these features by putting classes into modules. Some authorities recommend putting each class into a separate module but I find this simply creates an explosion of modules and increases rather than decreases complexity. Instead I group classes together and put the group into a module. Thus in our example above I might put all the bank account class definitions in one module, bankaccount, say, and then create a separate module for the application code that uses the module.\n\nWe can represent that graphically in UML in two ways. The logical grouping of the classes can be represented using a Package or we can represent the physical file as a component. The icons for these are shown below:\n\nComponent and package icons\n\nThe intention is that the Package icon should look somewhat like a folder in a typical file explorer tool. The little icon at top right in the component icon is actually the old UML symbol for a component but this was a bit cumbersome in diagrams when trying to draw lines showing relationships between components so they demoted it to a small embellishment in UML 2.0\n\nThat's all the UML I'll be covering, if you find it interesting and a useful way to visualise your design then a Google search will throw up lots of references and tutorials and you will find some UML drawing tools too, although the shapes are sufficiently easy to draw that you can use just about any vector graphics package.\n\nA simplified representation of that design would be:\n\n# File: bankaccount.py\n# Implements a set of bank account classes\n\nclass BankAccount: ....\n\nclass InterestAccount: ...\n\nclass ChargingAccount: ...\n\nAnd then to use it:\n\nimport bankaccount\n\nnewAccount = bankaccount.BankAccount(50)\nnewChrgAcct = bankaccount.ChargingAccount(200)\n\n# now do stuff\n\nBut what happens when we have two classes in different modules that need to access each others details? The simplest way is to import both modules, create local instances of the classes we need and pass the instances of one class to the other instance's methods. Passing whole objects around is what makes it object oriented programming. You don't need to extract the attributes out of one object and pass them into another, just pass the entire object. Now if the receiving object uses a polymorphic message to get at the information it needs then the method will work with any kind of object that supports the message.\n\nLet's make that more concrete by looking at an example. Let's create a short module called logger that contains two classes. The first class, called Logger, logs activity in a file. This logger will have a single method log() which takes a \"loggable object\" as a parameter. The other class in our module is a Loggable class that can be inherited by other classes to work with the logger. It looks like this:\n\n# File: logger.py\n# Create Loggable and Logger classes for logging activities \n# of objects\n\nclass Loggable:\n   def activity(self):\n       return \"This needs to be overridden locally\"\n\nclass Logger:\n   def __init__(self, logfilename = \"logger.dat\"):\n       self._log = open(logfilename,\"a\")\n   def log(self, loggedObj):\n       self._log.write(loggedObj.activity() + '\\n')\n\n   def __del__(self):\n\nNote that we have provided a destructor method (__del__) to close the file when the logger object is deleted or garbage collected. This is another \"magic method\" in Python (as shown by the double '_' characters) similar in many ways to __init__(). The difference is that whereas init is called when an instance is created, the del method is called just before the garbage collector deletes the instance. (There is a slight problem in that the del method may never be called if Python exits unexpectedly. But if that happens you are likely to have other issues to deal with too!)\n\nAlso notice that we've called the log attribute _log with a '_' character in front of the name. This is another common naming convention in Python, like using capitalized words for class names. A single underscore indicates that the attribute is not intended to be accessed directly, but only via the methods of the class.\n\nNow before we can use our module we will create a new module which defines loggable versions of our bank account classes:\n\n# File: loggablebankaccount.py\n# Extend Bank account classes to work with logger module.\n\nimport bankaccount, logger\n\nclass LoggableBankAccount(bankaccount.BankAccount, logger.Loggable):\n    def activity(self):\n       return \"Account balance = %d\" % self.checkBalance()\n\nclass LoggableInterestAccount(bankaccount.InterestAccount,\n    def activity(self):\n       return \"Account balance = %d\" % self.checkBalance()\n\nclass LoggableChargingAccount(bankaccount.ChargingAccount,\n    def activity(self):\n       return \"Account balance = %d\" % self.checkBalance()\n\nNotice we are using multiple inheritance, where we inherit not one but two parent classes. This isn't strictly needed in Python since we could just have added an activity() method to our original classes and achieved the same effect but in statically typed OOP languages such as Java or C++ this technique would be necessary so I will show you the technique here for future reference.\n\nThe sharp eyed amongst you may have noticed that the activity() method in all three classes is identical. That means we could save ourselves some typing by creating an intermediate type of loggable account class that inherits Loggable and only has an activity method. We can then create our three different loggable account types by inheriting from that new class as well as from the vanilla Loggable class. Like this:\n\nclass LoggableAccount(logger.Loggable):\n     def activity(self):\n         return \"Account balance = %d\" % self.checkBalance()\n\nclass LoggableBankAccount(bankaccount.BankAccount, LoggableAccount):\n\nclass LoggableInterestAccount(bankaccount.InterestAccount, LoggableAccount):\n\nclass LoggableChargingAccount(bankaccount.ChargingAccount, LoggableAccount):\n\nIt doesn't save a lot of code but it does mean we only have one method definition to test and maintain instead of three identical methods. This type of programming, where we introduce a superclass with shared functionality is sometimes called mixin programming and the minimal class is called a mixin class. It is a common outcome of this style that the final class definitions have little or no body but a long list of inherited classes, just as we see here. It's also quite common that mixin classes do not themselves inherit from anything, although in this case we did. In essence it's just a way of adding a common method (or set of methods) to a class or set of classes via the power of inheritance. (The term mixin originates in the world of ice cream parlours where different flavours of ice cream are added (or mixed in) to vanilla to produce a new flavour. The first language to support this style was called Flavors which was a popular dialect of Lisp for a while.)\n\nNow we come to the point of this exercise which is to show our application code creating a logger object and some bank accounts and passing the accounts to the logger, even though they are all defined in different modules!\n\n# Test logging and loggable bank accounts.\n\nimport logger\nimport loggablebankaccount as lba\n\nlog = logger.Logger()\n\nba = lba.LoggableBankAccount(100)\n\nintacc = lba.LoggableInterestAccount(200)\n\nNote the use of the as keyword to create a shortcut name when importing loggablebankaccount\n\nNote also that once we have created the local instances we no longer need to use the module prefix and because there is no direct access from one object to the other, it is all via messages, there is no need for the two class definition modules to directly refer to each other either. Finally notice also that the Logger works with instances of both LoggableBankAccount and LoggableInterestAccount because they both support the Loggable interface. Compatibility of object interfaces via polymorphism is the foundation upon which all OOP programs are built.\n\nI should point out that a much more sophisticated logging system is included in the standard library logging module, this one was purely to demonstrate some techniques. If you do really want logging facilities in your own programmes investigate the standard logging module first of all.\n\nHopefully this has given you a taste of Object Oriented Programming and you can move on to some of the other online tutorials, or read one of the books mentioned at the beginning for more information and examples. Now we will briefly look at how OOP is done in VBScript and JavaScript.\n\nOOP in VBScript\n\nVBScript supports the concept of objects and allows us to define classes and create instances, however it does not support the concepts of inheritance or polymorphism. VBScript is therefore what is known as Object Based rather than fully Object Oriented. Nonetheless the concepts of combining data and function in a single object remain useful, and a limited form of inheritance is possible using a technique called delegation which we discuss below.\n\nDefining classes\n\nA class is defined in VBScript using the Class statement, like this:\n\n<script type=text/VBScript>\nClass MyClass\n   Private anAttribute\n   Public Sub aMethodWithNoReturnValue()\n       MsgBox \"MyClass.aMethodWithNoReturnValue\"\n   End Sub\n   Public Function aMethodWithReturnValue()\n       MsgBox \"MyClass.aMethodWithReturnValue\"\n       aMethodWithReturnValue = 42\n   End Function\nEnd Class\n\nThis defines a new class called MyClass with an attribute called anAttribute which is only visible to the methods inside the class, as indicated by the keyword Private. It is conventional to declare data attributes to be Private and most methods to be Public. This is known as data hiding and has the advantage of allowing us to control access to the data by forcing methods to be used and the methods can do data quality checks on the values being passed in and out of the object. Python provides its own mechanism for achieving this but it is beyond the scope of this tutorial.\n\nCreating Instances\n\nWe create instances in VBScript with a combination of the Set and New keywords. The variable to which the new instance is assigned must also have been declared with the Dim keyword as is the usual VBScript style.\n\n<script type=text/VBScript>\nDim anInstance\nSet anInstance = New MyClass\n\nThis creates an instance of the class declared in the previous section and assigns it to the anInstance variable. Notice that you must precede the variable name with Set and use the New keyword to create the object.\n\nSending Messages\n\nMessages are sent to instances using the same dot notation used by Python.\n\n<script type=text/VBScript>\nDim aValue\naValue = anInstance.aMethodWithReturnValue()\nMsgBox \"aValue = \" & aValue\n\nThe two methods declared in the class definition are called, in the first case there is no return value, in the second we assign the return value to the variable aValue. There is nothing unusual here apart from the fact that the subroutine and function are preceded by the instance name.\n\nInheritance and Polymorphism\n\nVBScript as a language does not provide any inheritance mechanism nor any mechanism for polymorphism. However we can fake it to some degree by using a technique called delegation. This simply means that we define an attribute of the sub class to be an instance of the theoretical parent class. We then define a method for all of the \"inherited\" methods which simply calls (or delegates to), the method of the parent instance. Let's subclass MyClass as defined above:\n\n<script type=text/VBScript>\nClass SubClass\n   Private parent\n   Private Sub Class_Initialize()\n      Set parent = New MyClass\n   End Sub\n   Public Sub aMethodWithNoReturnValue()\n   End Sub\n   Public Function aMethodWithReturnValue()\n      aMethodWithReturnValue = parent.aMethodWithReturnValue\n   End Function\n   Public Sub aNewMethod\n      MsgBox \"This is unique to the sub class\"\n   End Sub\nEnd Class\n\nDim inst,aValue\nSet inst = New SubClass\naValue = inst.aMethodWithReturnValue\nMsgBox \"aValue = \" & CStr(aValue)\n\nThe key points to note here are the use of the private attribute parent and the special, private method Class_Initialise. The former is the superclass delegate attribute and the latter is the equivalent of Python's __init__ method for initializing instances when they are created, it is the VBScript constructor in other words.\n\nOOP in JavaScript\n\nJavaScript supports objects using a technique called prototyping. This means that there is no explicit class construct in JavaScript and instead we can define a class in terms of a set of functions, or as a dictionary-like concept known as an initializer.\n\nDefining classes\n\nThe most common way to define a JavaScript \"class\" is to create a function with the same name as the class, effectively this is the constructor, but is not contained within any other construct. It looks like this:\n\n<script type=text/JavaScript>\nfunction MyClass(theAttribute)\n   this.anAttribute = theAttribute;\n\nYou might notice the keyword this which is used in the same way as Python's self as a placeholder reference to the current instance. (You will notice however that we don't need to explicitly include this in the parameter list of the class' methods.)\n\nWe can add new attributes to the class later using the built in prototype attribute like this:\n\n<script type=text/JavaScript>\nMyClass.prototype.newAttribute = null;\n\nThis defines a new attribute of MyClass called newAttribute.\n\nMethods are added by defining a normal function then assigning the function name to a new attribute with the name of the method. Normally the method and function have the same name, but there is nothing to stop you calling the methods something different, as illustrated below:\n\n<script type=text/JavaScript>\nfunction oneMethod(){\n    return this.anAttribute;\nMyClass.prototype.getAttribute = oneMethod;\nfunction printIt(){\n    document.write(this.anAttribute + \"<BR>\");\nMyClass.prototype.printIt = printIt;\n\nOf course it would be more convenient to define the functions first then finish up with the constructor and assign the methods inside the constructor and this is in fact the normal approach, so that the full class definition looks like this:\n\n<script type=text/JavaScript>\nfunction oneMethod(){\n    return this.anAttribute;\n\nfunction printIt(){\n    document.write(this.anAttribute + \"<BR>\");\n\nfunction MyClass(theAttribute)\n   this.anAttribute = theAttribute;\n   this.getAttribute = oneMethod;\n   this.printIt = printIt;\n\nThere is another way to do this in JavaScript, which is to use a slightly different syntax for creating the method functions. JavaScript allows us to define a function like this:\n\n\nAnd we can call that as usual like:\n\ndocument.write(\"The square of 5 is: \" + square(5))\n\nNow applying that to our class definition we get:\n\n<script type=text/JavaScript>\nfunction MyClass(theAttribute)\n   this.anAttribute = theAttribute;\n   this.getAttribute = function(){\n                       return this.anAttribute;\n   this.printIt = function printIt(){\n                  document.write(this.anAttribute + \"<BR>\");\n\nThis approach is preferred by some programmers because it keeps the method definitions inside the class with no pollution of the outer namespace. Others find it a bit messy and harder to read. The choice is yours.\n\nCreating Instances\n\nWe create instances of classes using the keyword new, like this:\n\n<script type=text/JavaScript>\nvar anInstance = new MyClass(42);\n\nWhich creates a new instance called anInstance.\n\nSending Messages\n\nSending messages in JavaScript is no different to our other languages, we use the familiar dot notation.\n\n<script type=text/JavaScript>\ndocument.write(\"The attribute of anInstance is: <BR>\");\n\nInheritance and Polymorphism\n\nUnlike VBScript it is possible to use JavaScript's prototyping mechanism to inherit from another class. It is rather more complex than the Python technique but is not completely unmanageable, but it is, in my experience, a relatively uncommon technique among JavaScript programmers.\n\nThe key to inheritance in JavaScript is the prototype keyword (we used it in passing in the code above). By using prototype we can effectively add features to an object after it has been defined. We can see this in action here:\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\nfunction Message(text){\n   this.text = text;\n   this.say = function(){\n        document.write(this.text + '<br>');\n\nmsg1 = new Message('This is the first');\n\nMessage.prototype.shout = function(){\n\nmsg2 = new Message('This gets the new feature');\n\n/* But so did msg1...*/\n\n\nNote 1: We added the new alert method using prototype after creating instance msg1 of the class but the feature was available to the existing instance as well as to the instance, msg2 created after the addition. That is, the new feature gets added to all instances of Message both existing and new.\n\nThis prototyping feature gives rise to the interesting capability to change the behaviour of built-in JavaScript objects, either adding new features or changing the way existing features function! Use this capability with great care if you don't want to spend your time grappling with really confusing bugs.\n\nThis use of prototype as a mechanism for adding functionality to existing classes has the disadvantage that it alters the existing instance behaviours and changes the original class definition.\n\nMore conventional style inheritance is available too, as shown below:\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\nfunction Parent(){\n   this.name = 'Parent';\n   this.basemethod = function(){\n       alert('This is the parent');\n\nfunction Child(){\n   this.parent = Parent;\n   this.submethod = function(){\n       alert('This from the child');\n\nvar aParent = new Parent();\nvar aChild = new Child();\n\n\n\nThe key point to note here is that the Child object has access to the basemethod without it being explicitly granted, it has inherited it from the parent class by virtue of the assignment/call pair of lines:\n\n   this.parent = Parent;\n\nwithin the Child class definition. And thus we have inherited the basemethod from the Parent class!\n\nThe JavaScript Controversy\n\nJavaScript has a rather bad reputation amongst the programming fraternity, for lots of reasons. To give one example: it is possible to try to create objects without using the new keyword. JavaScript allows you to do this without reporting any error but the result is not what you would expect and usually results in a very hard to find bug.\n\nOne of the reasons for this is that JavaScript does not really have a class concept at all but \"fakes it\" via the prototype mechanism. To get round some of the issues, JavaScript programmers have developed some idioms that produce much more robust code. Unfortunately the explanation of them requires some advanced computer science concepts that are beyond the scope of this tutorial. If you are serious about using JavaScript for OOP you should read the short book, \"JavaScript the Good Parts\", by Douglas Crockford which explains why the techniques above are not ideal and how to do it better.\n\nWe can, of course, use the same delegation trick we used with VBScript. Here is the VBScript example translated into JavaScript:\n\n<script type=text/JavaScript>\nfunction noReturn(){\n\nfunction returnValue(){\n      return this.parent.getAttribute();\n\nfunction newMethod(){\n      document.write(\"This is unique to the sub class<BR>\");\n\nfunction SubClass(){\n   this.parent = new MyClass(27);\n   this.aMethodWithNoReturnValue = noReturn; \n   this.aMethodWithReturnValue = returnValue;\n   this.aNewMethod = newMethod;\n\nvar inst, aValue;\ninst = new SubClass(); // define superclass \ndocument.write(\"The sub class value is:<BR>\");\naValue = inst.aMethodWithReturnValue();\ndocument.write(\"aValue = \" + aValue);\n\nWe will see classes and objects being used in the following topics and case studies. It is not always obvious to a beginner how this, apparently complex, construct can make programs easier to write and understand but hopefully as you see classes being used in real programs it will become clearer. One thing I would like to say is that, for very small programs they do not really help and almost certainly will make the program longer. However, as your programs start to get bigger - over about 100 lines say - then you will find that classes and objects really can help to keep things organized and even reduce the amount of code you write.\n\nIf you are one of those who finds the whole OOP concept confusing don't panic, many people have programmed for their whole lives without ever creating a single class! On the other hand, if you can get to grips with objects it does open up some powerful new techniques.\n\nThings to Remember\n\nPrevious\u00a0 Next",

    "prompt": "Zinc transporters and insulin resistance: therapeutic implications for type 2 diabetes and metabolic disease\n\nJournal of Biomedical Science, Nov 2017\n\nJohn Adulcikas, Shaghayegh Norouzi, Stephen Myers, Sukhwinder Singh Sohal\n\n\n\n\n\nNorouzi et al. Journal of Biomedical Science Zinc transporters and insulin resistance: therapeutic implications for type 2 diabetes and metabolic disease Shaghayegh Norouzi 0 John Adulcikas 0 Sukhwinder Singh Sohal 0 Stephen Myers 0 0 Faculty of Health, School of Health Sciences, University of Tasmania , Newnham Campus, Launceston, TAS 7250 , Australia Background: Zinc is a metal ion that is essential for growth and development, immunity, and metabolism, and therefore vital for life. Recent studies have highlighted zinc's dynamic role as an insulin mimetic and a cellular second messenger that controls many processes associated with insulin signaling and other downstream pathways that are amendable to glycemic control. Main body: Mechanisms that contribute to the decompartmentalization of zinc and dysfunctional zinc transporter mechanisms, including zinc signaling are associated with metabolic disease, including type 2 diabetes. The actions of the proteins involved in the uptake, storage, compartmentalization and distribution of zinc in cells is under intense investigation. Of these, emerging research has highlighted a role for several zinc transporters in the initiation of zinc signaling events in cells that lead to metabolic processes associated with maintaining insulin sensitivity and thus glycemic homeostasis. Conclusion: This raises the possibility that zinc transporters could provide novel utility to be targeted experimentally and in a clinical setting to treat patients with insulin resistance and thus introduce a new class of drug target with utility for diabetes pharmacotherapy. Zinc ions; Skeletal muscle; Cell signaling; Glycemic control Background Insulin resistance (IR) is a common pathophysiological condition in which patients present with reduced insulin sensitivity and thus glucose intolerance, particularly in liver, adipose tissue and skeletal muscle [ 1 ]. This has significant implications for the patient, as they are unable to obtain to process the required energy from glucose to maintain cellular metabolic processes. IR is of major global concern as it is well-established as underpinning many chronic health conditions including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), obesity, cardiovascular disease polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), liver cirrhosis [ 2 ] atherosclerosis, hypertension, and stroke [ 3 ]. Moreover, given that IR usually precedes the development of T2DM and contributes to the progressive nature of this challenging and devastating disease, understanding the molecular mechanisms that lead to IR will help facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies to prevent or lessen disease progression. However, despite extensive ongoing research into IR, its molecular mechanism(s) of action remains largely elusive. Recently, research on metabolic processes associated with IR and T2DM has revealed an exciting role for the biochemical and physiological role of zinc and the proteins that transport zinc in cells in diseases associated with abnormal cellular signaling [ 4 ]. Accordingly, zinc and the proteins that transport this metal ion have emerged as potential therapeutic targets for disease states associated with dysfunctional metabolism. For example, zinc in the diet and zinc transporter proteins that influence/regulate zinc metabolism are implicated in metabolic homeostasis in peripheral tissues (e.g. skeletal muscle and liver) that respond to insulin [ 4 ]. Zinc is ubiquitous in physiological systems, albeit, within tightly controlled parameters, and therefore suggests that atypical levels are likely to have significant biological and clinical effects on disease processes. Knowing how zinc transporter proteins and the storage of zinc in cells are involved in metabolic processes implicated in IR for example, may present opportunities to develop novel drugs targeting these transporters to prevent or treat IR and T2DM disease progression. Type 2 diabetes mellitus Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is devastating disorder characterised by hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycaemia, compromised energy metabolism and expenditure, and the progression of chronic illness and disease. T2DM is high complex involving both genetic predisposition and environmental factors. A major factor involved in a person\u2019s susceptibility to T2DM can be linked through family history of diabetes. For example, Pacific Islander peoples are a unique population with especially high rates of T2DM [ 5 ]. The environment also plays a major role in the development of IR and T2DM with inactivity and poor nutritional status being two key factors [ 6 ]. Development of T2DM The development of T2DM is preceded by IR, a disorder associated with hyperinsulinemia, glucose intolerance and dysfunctional energy metabolism [ 7 ]. A leading concern for people with IR is the progressive failure of pancreatic \u03b2-cell function (a major determinant of T2DM progression) and thus, compromised insulin secretion [ 8 ]. T2DM occurs primarily due to pancreatic \u03b2-cell failure, including disruption of \u03b2-cell function and mass [ 8 ]. Elevated blood glucose causes the pancreatic \u03b2-cells to produce more insulin resulting in hyperinsulinemia. Thus, pancreatic \u03b2-cells amplify insulin synthesis as well as insulin secretion pathways to overcome IR through an adaptive response called \u03b2-cell compensation [ 9 ]. Consequently, the failure of \u03b2-cells occurs in response to elevated insulin levels and thus elevated blood glucose which results in insulin insufficiency and overt diabetes. Accordingly, T2DM patients with loss of \u03b2-cell function will cease to live a normal life and will endure life-long pharmacological intervention, often with episodes of illness from unfavourable side-effects associated with the anti-diabetic treatments. Therefore, prevention strategies that take advantage of this \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d (before \u03b2-cell failure) to prevent or lessen disease progression would have an enormous impact on the health and wellbeing of our communities. Current drug treatments for T2DM There are a range of medicines available to manage and treat IR and T2DM, however, side effects of these drugs have always been a foremost challenge in relation to the goal of pharmacotherapy [ 10 ] (Table 1). Yet, treatments for IR have not advanced significantly in the last few decades because of the inadequate knowledge about the pleiotropic effects that these drugs have on specific molecular targets [ 11 ]. Therefore, finding strategies to increase the efficacy and safety of therapeutic treatment for IR and T2DM is highly critical. In this context, research over the last decade has suggested a role for zinc in the treatment of T2DM [ 12 ]. For example, lowered zinc concentrations have been identified in some patients with T2DM [ 13 ] and zinc supplementation appears to improve the effectiveness of oral hypoglycaemic agents, decreasing blood glucose, triglycerides and inflammation in some patients [ 14 ]. However, many of these kinds of studies are not consistent in their findings and adds further complications in determining a role for zinc in these processes. Thus, it will be important to look at the role of zinc transporters and how they transport zinc within a cellular context during disease progression. Zinc Zinc is an essential trace element that is found in all parts of the body including the fluids and secretions, tissues and organs. Zinc is one of the most abundant trace metals (next to iron) in the human body, containing approximately 2\u20134 g [ 15 ]. The concentration of zinc in tissues is highest in the prostate (approximately 200 \u03bcg/ml), followed by the pancreas (approximately 40 \u03bcg/ml) and then muscle (approximately 50 \u03bcg/ml). In human plasma, there is approximately 14\u201316 \u03bcM of total zinc that is distributed to cells and subcellular organelles [ 15 ]. In multicellular organisms, almost all zinc is intracellular with the nucleus harbouring approximately 30\u201340%, the cytoplasm, organelles and specialised vesicles approximately 50%, and the cell membrane has about 10% [ 12 ]. Under normal cellular conditions there is no free zinc and therefore, the compartmentalization and distribution of cellular zinc is highly important and tightly controlled so that zinc homeostasis is maintained with an appropriate cellular concentration and physiological range. This is achieved by a family of zinc transporter proteins and metallothioneins [ 16, 17 ]. Metallothioneins and zinc transporters Two families of zinc transporter proteins and zinc buffering proteins play a critical role in the influx, efflux, buffering and compartmentalization of zinc. These are the zinc transporters (ZnT proteins and Zrt/Irt-like ZIP proteins), and the intracellular zinc-binding metallothionein (MT) proteins [18]. MT proteins are a group of soluble low molecular weight metal binding proteins that buffer and translocate zinc within the cytosol [ 19 ]. The ZIP and ZnT1 zinc transporters belong to a family of transmembrane proteins that control zinc movement and thus zinc concentrations in cells. The ZnT family members (ZnT1\u201310) are involved in depleting cytosolic zinc by moving this metal ion into intracellular organelles or from the extracellular space while the ZIP family members increase cytosolic zinc by transporting this metal ion from outside the cell or from intracellular organelles (Fig. 1). ZIP transporter family The original member of the ZIP family of zinc transporters was identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (designated ZRT1) based on an amino acid sequence similarity to that of Irt1p, an Fe(II) regulated transporter from Arabidopsis thaliana [ 20, 21 ]. Consistent with the proposed role of ZRT1 in zinc uptake, zinc uptake was increased when this transporter was overexpressed in yeast cells. Similarly, a mutation that disrupted the function of ZRT1 led to reduced levels of zinc uptake and poor cellular growth in the mutant yeast strain [21]. The ZIP family of zinc transporters have a predicted eight transmembrane domain (TMD) structure and this is orientated with the N- and C-terminal facing the extracytosolic region. Many of these members have a predicted long histidine-rich loop region (HXn, n = 3\u20135) situated between TMD 3 and TMD 4 that is suggested to serve as a zinc-binding site (Fig. 2) [ 22, 23 ]. In mammals, there are at least fourteen ZIP transporters that have critical roles in the transport of zinc into cytoplasm from extracellular sources and intracellular storage compartments such as the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum, when the cytosolic zinc is depleted. The ZIP transporters are regulated by intracellular and extracellular zinc concentrations, and hormones and cytokines. They are also expressed in several tissues and cell types and their proteins are localized to specific subcellular compartments and have been extensively reviewed elsewhere [24]. ZnT transporter family The ZnT zinc transporters are a large family that include members with similar structural homology to bacteria, fungi, nematodes, insects, plants and mammals [ 25 ]. This family is predicted to have six transmembrane domains (TMDs) with a histidine-rich loop region between TMD 4 and TMD 5 (Fig. 2). The original mammalian ZnT was identified from a rodent cDNA library and was shown experimentally to confer resistance to zinc toxicity in baby hamster kidney cell lines [ 26 ]. Since the discovery of ZnT1, nine other members have been identified (designated SLC30A1\u201310). ZnTs are implicated in the transport of zinc into subcellular organelles and from the cytosol through the plasma membrane into the extracellular space [ 25 ]. Like the ZIPs, the ZnTs are regulated by intracellular and extracellular zinc, hormones, and cytokines and are extensively reviewed elsewhere [ 24 ]. Zinc, zinc transporters and cellular signaling: A prelude to cell signaling and insulin resistance Changes in zinc compartmentalization and availability in cells is typically detected and regulated by the intrinsic control of zinc transporter proteins. The cellular homeostasis of zinc is highly complex and there are several highly significant reviews on these processes [ 12, 15, 16, 27\u201330 ]. Accordingly, this section of the review aims to delineate the mechanisms by which zinc, and zinc transporters contribute to cell signaling and how these processes might provide insights into the molecular mechanisms implicated in disease processes such as insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Zinc mimics the action of several molecules implicated in cellular metabolism including hormones, growth factors, and cytokines, and given the large number of mammalian zinc transporters that regulate zinc homeostasis, it is not surprising that this metal ion has been highlighted as a leading signaling molecule like calcium. Two modes of zinc signaling have been described. These are 1) early zinc signaling (EZS) and, 2) late zinc signaling (LZS). EZS, is a process that is independent of gene transcription and results in rapid changes in intracellular levels of zinc that occurs in minutes (the \u2018zinc wave\u2019 response) through the triggered release of zinc from subcellular organelles into the cytosol [ 31 ]. This phenomenon was first shown in studies in mast cells where an extracellular stimulation of these cells with the high affinity IgE resulted in a rapid increase in intracellular zinc from the endoplasmic reticulum within minutes [ 32 ]. LZS can also be triggered by extracellular stimuli but involves transcriptional-dependent changes in genes and thus proteins that are involved in zinc homeostasis such as storage proteins or transporters [ 33 ]. The importance of these two mechanisms of EZS and LZS highlight the diverse roles that this metal ion plays in processes that require rapid signals (such as metabolism) and more longterm functions such as cell differentiation and cell growth. The defining role of zinc as a signaling molecule was shown in early studies in rat adipocytes where zinc could stimulate lipogenesis, independent, and additive to that of insulin [ 34 ]. Similarly, in rat adipocytes, zinc activated cAMP phosphodiesterase and the mobilization of glucose transporters to the plasma membrane, independent of insulin receptor kinase activity [ 35 ]. Since these studies implicating zinc as a signaling molecule, there is increasing evidence suggesting zinc acts in extracellular signal recognition [ 32 ], second messenger activity [ 36 ], protein kinase activity [ 37 ], protein phosphorylation [ 38 ], and transcription factor regulation [ 39 ]. These studies clearly highlight the role of zinc in signaling processes that are also associated with insulin-mediated metabolism. The mechanisms of the insulin-mimetic action of zinc have been delineated in several studies however it is still unclear how these processes occur. One well-established mechanism of zinc action on cellular signaling events occurs through the inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B). PTP1B functions as a negative regulator of insulin and leptin signaling transduction pathways [ 40 ]. Thus, the inhibition of PTP1B by zinc ions can prolong the insulin signal through the insulin receptor. Similarly, the ability of zinc to modulate glucose transport, glycogen synthesis, lipogenesis, to inhibit gluconeogenesis and lipolysis, and to regulate key elements of the insulin signaling pathway [ 41 ] suggests that this metal ion could provide therapeutic insight or utility in the management and/or treatment of insulin resistance. This is an interesting notion in a clinical context since patients that are insulin resistance have a \u201cblunted\u201d response to insulin and subsequent downstream cellular signaling responses. Therefore, the activation of cellular insulin signaling cascade that is critical to achieve glycemic control might involve zinc. However, the question remains as to whether zinc independently activates critical molecules involved in cellular signaling in the absence of insulin or whether zinc requires insulin for these processes. Zinc transporters, cellular signaling and insulin resistance Given the well-established role of zinc transporters in mediating the critical control of zinc homeostasis in cells, it will be important to further delineate their function in cell signaling events in the context of metabolic control. Currently, information is limited to what role the zinc transporters might play in cell signaling events in the context of insulin resistance. Therefore, extrapolation of studies from other cellular systems or disease states that have identified zinc transporters and thus zinc flux in facilitating cell signaling events might prove useful. Studies accessing the role of zinc transporters in cellular signaling found that the zinc transporters ZnT5 and ZnT7 are responsible for loading zinc to alkaline phosphatases (ALPs) in the biosynthetic-secretory pathway in chicken B lymphocyte-derived cells [ 42 ]. These authors noted that mutant cells lacking both ZnTs resulted in a marked loss in ALP activity and this activity could be restored by overexpressing both ZnT5 and ZnT7. Similarly, the cooperative activity of ZnT1, ZnT4 and metallothioneins are required for the full activation of alkaline ALP in the early-secretory pathway [ 43 ]. Accordingly, the above studies demonstrate that ALP can be activated by the ZnT family of zinc transporters and therefore aid in the control of numerous cellular events. In other studies, ZnT1 can regulate Raf-1 enzymatic activity in Xenopus oocytes and cultured mammalian cells [ 44 ]. Raf-1 plays a critical role in signal transduction in eukaryote cells where it phosphorylates and activates MEK1, a protein threonine and tyrosine kinase that activates the MAPK family members ERK1 and ERK2 [ 45 ]. ZnT1 was shown to bind to the amino end of the Raf-1 protein and promote kinase activation. Moreover, increasing the concentration of intracellular zinc inhibited Ras-mediated signaling through zinc blocking the ability of ZnT1 to bind Raf-1 [ 44 ] suggesting that Raf-1 activity requires functional ZnT1. Of the ZIP transporters, ZIP14 is important in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR)-mediated signaling through the maintenance of intracellular cAMP levels via suppression of phosphodiesterase activity [ 46 ]. In these studies, fasting gluconeogenesis is impaired in the livers of ZIP14 knockout mice which was attributable to changes in GPCR signaling processes. Similarly, in ZIP14 knock-out mouse chondrocytes, parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP)mediated c-fos activity was significantly reduced. PTHrP stimulates the phosphorylation of cAMP response elementbinding protein (CREB) which in turn induces the transcription of c-fos [ 47 ]. Studies in MCF breast cancer cell lines have identified that ZIP7 is essential in the redistribution of zinc from intracellular stores to the cytoplasm and subsequent zincinduced inhibition of phosphatases [ 36 ]. Moreover, ZIP7 knock-down in these cells prevented the zinc-induced activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), insulinlike growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), and protein kinase B (AKT); key molecules implicated in cellular metabolism. In fact, ZIP7 has been coined the \u201cgatekeeper\u201d of cytosolic release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus [ 48 ]. ZIP7 is phosphorylated by CK2 in MCF-7 cells and this activation leads to the \u201cgated\u201d release of zinc from the ER and the subsequent activation of multiple downstream signaling pathways including AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1and 2 (ERK1/2) [ 48 ]. ZIP7 is essential for the proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells and mice lacking this transporter in intestinal epithelium have massive apoptosis of transit-amplifying cells due to increased endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER) [ 49 ]. Similarly, studies identified that the phosphorylation of ZIP7 was increased in cardiomyocytes under hyperglycemia conditions and was implicated in driving ER stress [ 50 ]. Given that ZIP7 facilitates the release of zinc from the ER [ 48 ] and ablation of ZIP7 in mesenchymal stem cells led to the accumulation of zinc in the ER and subsequent ER dysfunction [ 51 ], it is plausible that ZIP7 could also be implicated in ER stress in type 2 diabetes. Undeniably, ER stress and the dysregulation of ER function in pancreatic beta cells are central in the pathogenesis of diabetes [ 52 ]. Previously we have identified a role for ZIP7 in glycemic control in skeletal muscle [ 53 ]. Skeletal muscle acts as a major reservoir for zinc containing approximately 60% of total whole-body zinc [ 54 ]. Knock-down of ZIP7 in C2C12 mouse skeletal muscle cells led to a significant reduction in several genes and proteins involved in glucose metabolism including the insulin receptor (Ir), insulin receptor substrates 1 and 2 (Irs1 and Irs2), the phosphorylation of Akt, glucose transporter Glut4, and glycogen branching enzyme (Gbe) [ 53 ]. These data suggest that ZIP7 controls glucose metabolism via the phosphorylation of Akt and Glut4 mobilization (Fig. 3). It is not clear if reduced ZIP7 and thus reduced zinc levels leads to changes associated with the phosphorylation status of the insulin receptor substrates directly, or if reduced ZIP7 leads to inhibition of insulin receptor signaling via binding of PTP-1B. Studies have identified that the ZIPs play a major role in regulating cytosolic zinc homeostasis and insulin secretion [ 55 ]. In these studies, it was suggested that the zinc transporters ZIP6 and ZIP7 may have a role in insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells via alterations in cytosolic and/or subcellular organelle-specific zinc pools. The down regulation of these transporters via knock-down studies led to a significant reduction in glucose-stimulated zinc uptake and oxidative stress in mouse islet cells [ 55 ]. These authors speculate that reduced expression of ZIP6 and ZIP7 may disrupt zinc homeostasis and thus produce defects in insulin secretion and beta cell viability that could potentially lead to the development of diabetes. Recent studies have shown a relationship with ZIP13 and beige adipocyte biogenesis and thermogenesis [ 56 ]. In primary white preadipocytes isolated from white fat from ZIP13 null mice, there was a slight increase in common white fat genes but a significant increase in the gene expression of brown-fat specific genes and suggests that this transporter is implicated the inhibition of beige fat differentiation [ 56 ]. Moreover, these authors demonstrated that ubiquinated C/EBP-\u03b2 was decreased in ZIP13 null mice. C/EBP is a major regulator of adipogenesis through the activation of genes essential for mitotic clonal expansion and thus, terminal adipocyte differentiation [ 57 ]. Accordingly, these studies suggest that ZIP13 deletion promotes beige adipocyte production and is associated with increased exergy expenditure, reduced diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. ZIP14 has been identified as a critical route for nontransferrin bound iron (NTBI) uptake into liver and pancreatic acinar cells and is essential for the development of liver iron overload in hemochromatosis [ 58 ]. Diabetes is frequently associated with hemochromatosis and patients with type 2 diabetes present with high ferritin levels which correlate with diabetic retinopathy [ 59 ]. Similarly, ZIP14 knock-out mice have enlarged pancreatic islets, low grade inflammation, and subsequent hyperinsulinemia and increased body fat which are characteristic of type 2 diabetes [ 60 ]. Do the zinc transporters and zinc signaling play a role in insulin resistance and the progression of type 2 diabetes? Zinc plays a major role in many aspects of cell signaling events in several physiological and pathophysiological processes. While it is well established that at least one zinc transporter (ZnT8) is critical for the compartmentalization, structure and secretion of insulin in beta cells of the pancreas [ 30 ], there is little information about the other family members in this context. Nonetheless, given the important role that zinc transporters play in delivering bioactive zinc to extracellular, cytosolic and subcellular milieu, and the action of this metal ion on cell signaling events, it is highly tempting to speculate that aberrant storage and release of zinc will result in unfavorable processes associated with insulin signaling and glycemic control. ZnT8 and type 2 diabetes Zinc is critical for the physiological role of insulin in the form of storage in the secretory granules of the pancreas as an inactive zinc-insulin hexamer [ 61, 62 ]. When the zinc-insulin hexamer is released into the blood circulation, a change in pH drives the dissociation of the complex into a bioactive monomer of insulin [63]. The zinc transporter that initializes zinc movement into insulin granules of the pancreatic \u03b2-cells is ZnT8. In fact, this transporter is almost exclusively localized in pancreatic \u03b2-cells and it is critical for the synthesis, storage and action of insulin [ 64 ]. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have discovered that a nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in ZnT8 (rs13266634) encodes a C \u2192 T base substitution resulting in a change in the coded protein (p.Arg325Trp) and the production of two protein variants R and W of which the C allele (R variant) is associated with susceptibility to type 2 diabetes [ 65 ]. The frequency of the diabetes risk R allele is 91.5%, 71.7% and 56.7% in Africans, Europeans, and Asians, respectively [ 66 ]. Moreover, the corresponding at-risk R325 variant had reduced zinc transporter activity compared to the W325 ZnT8 in pancreatic beta-cell lines. Therefore, carriers of the R325 variant may have compromised packaging of insulin in pancreatic betacell granules [ 67 ]. In studies of 846 European individuals, each of whom had a parent with type 2 diabetes, it was demonstrated that homozygous carriers of the major C risk-allele variant had compromised pancreatic \u03b2-cell insulin secretion following an intravenous glucose load [ 68 ]. It was suggested by these authors that the function and/or production of ZnT8 in carriers of the C risk allele is reduced and therefore likely to contribute to compromised pancreatic beta-cell function. Although GWAS studies have been successful in identifying variant ZnT8 alleles, it does not necessarily imply that the risk allele has a direct pathophysiological effect on beta-cell insulin secretion. A Meta-Analysis of Glucose and Insulin-related traits Consortium (MAGIC) was recently formed to conduct large-scale meta-analyses of genome-wide data for continuous diabetes-related traits in non-diabetics [ 69 ]. Meta-analyses were performed on approximately 2.5 M directly genotyped or imputed SNPs from twenty-one GWAS that were informative for fasting glucose (FG), fasting insulin (FI) and, pancreatic beta-cell function (HOMA-B) and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in non-diabetic participants [ 69 ]. It was identified that the risk allele for ZnT8 was associated with higher FG levels and an increase in two-hour glucose response in non-diabetics. Although these studies identified several genetic glycemic risk loci for type 2 diabetes, including ZnT8, not all loci are associated with pathological levels of glucose and type 2 diabetes risk. More recent studies that sequenced approximately 150,000 individuals across five ancestry groups reported twelve rare protein-truncating mutations in ZnT8 which together explain a 65% reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes [ 70 ]. It was found that a nonsense variant encoding (c.412C \u2192 T, p.Arg138*) heterozygosity yielded a 53% reduction in type 2 diabetes risk. Similarly, heterozygosity for the variant encoding p.Lys34Serfs*50 which is predicted to cause a frameshift and loss of all six ZnT8 transmembrane domains was associated with an 80% reduction in type 2 diabetes risk. Recently, studies aimed to delineate the effect of dietary factor interactions with ZnT8 polymorphism (rs13266634) and the risk of developing metabolic syndrome found a significant interaction among omega-3 fatty acid consumption and ZnT8 in the context of metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, and abdominal obesity [ 71 ]. Participants with the CC genotype benefited more from the consumption of omega3 fatty acids than carriers of the CT + TT genotypes. Carriers of the CC genotype had reduced risk of developing these disease states with increased consumption of omega3 fatty acids. Moreover, the risk of abdominal obesity in the CT + TT genotype groups increased significantly with salty snack consumption but not in the CC homozygote carriers. Studies to investigate the role of ZnT8 and glucose homeostasis has been established with ZnT8 null mouse models with global deletion of ZnT8 or pancreatic betacell specific ZnT8 deletion [ 72 ]. Most models resulted in impaired or unaltered glucose tolerance, however in ZnT8-depleted beta cells insulin granule abnormalities were observed, and this was concomitant with a loss of zinc release from secretory granules [ 73 ]. Similarly, ZnT8specific deletion in beta cells resulted in reduced peripheral insulin concentrations despite an unexpected increase in insulin secretion from isolated ZnT8-depleted islets [ 74 ]. These authors suggest that secreted insulin from the pancreas in the ZnT8 knock-out mouse suppresses hepatic insulin clearance and dysregulation of this process could play a role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. A recent study [ 75 ] revealed ZnT8 deletion in mouse betacells resulted in a significant impairment in zinc release, normal or increased insulin secretion and subsequent impairment in glucose tolerance. Moreover, transgenic mice that overexpressed ZnT8 in beta cells showed a significant improvement in zinc release, lower levels of insulin secretion and improved glucose tolerance [ 75 ]. Given the pancreatic tissue-specificity of ZnT8 there is potential for this transporter to be amendable to therapy in the treatment of diabetes. However, targeting ZnT8 in the treatment of diabetes could prove to be highly complex. Although results from ZnT8 null mice suggest that increasing ZnT8 could improve insulin secretion and glycemic control, loss of function mutations in ZnT8 suggest a protective role for this transporter in type 2 diabetes. While ZnT8 plays a critical role in insulin physiology, and over the last decade or so this transporter has been given much attention for its role in diabetes, other zinc transporters have not had the same focused attention until recently. Apart from the many studies on zinc signaling in cells and the insulin-mimetic action of zinc, it is unclear which zinc transporters are involved in initiating these signaling processes. Clues from studies on the role of ZIP7 as the \u201cgate-keeper\u201d of zinc release from the Golgi apparatus [ 48 ] and subsequent ZIP7-mediated cell signaling events in skeletal muscle [ 49 ] no doubt place this transporter in an important position for further studies. Identifying how the zinc transporters are implicated in zinc signaling events that are amendable to insulin signaling processes in insulin resistance may help elucidate novel therapeutic options for the treatment of early diabetic symptoms and thus the long-term management of this disorder and associated type 2 diabetes. Conclusion Zinc is an essential metal ion that is ubiquitous in many metabolic and physiological processes. The emerging role of zinc as an insulin mimetic in maintaining cellular function suggests that atypical levels, and aberrant compartmentalization, transport and storage of zinc will have biological effects that could be amendable to clinical intervention. Although current understandings on the role of zinc transporters in insulin resistance is not available, and this knowledge is only just emerging in type 2 diabetes, it is clear from studies on ZnT8 that this family of transporters has utility for the development of novel diabetic therapies. While ZnT8 plays a significant role in insulin biology and therefore represents an attractive target for diabetes therapy, the other members of the zinc transporter family in diabetes are less defined. However, we can speculate from the information presented in this review that the other transporters are involved in processes that facilitate insulin signaling and glycemic control and therefore could offer exciting new targets that are amendable to therapeutic intervention in the treatment of diseases associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.

    "prompt": "Where in the evolutionary chain did morality start to evolve?\n\n\n\nOne could argue that there is a common moral standard in dominant cultures, and most atheists conclude that morality is a social need gradually evolved in organisms. But at which stage of the evolution did morality started to evolve, e.g. monkeys, chimpanzees, or even the first mammals?\n\nAlso, if morality evolved solely for better functioning of social organisms, why did we evolve to pity others? Caring for the young is understandable to me but lending beggars a coin does not seem to be beneficial, so why did it evolve?\n\n\nPosted 2017-11-26T01:04:39.157\n\nReputation: 119\n\n12There is no \"evolution chain\", morality isn't developed through biological evolution, and your premises are bogus. \u2013 hobbs \u2013 2017-11-26T04:03:54.610\n\n4morality has nothing to do with evolutionary theory, there is no correlation between the two. You also must discriminate between evolutionary facts and evolutionary theories. There are several evolutionary theories that are based upon the evolutionary facts. Don't confuse facts with theories. btw, even ant colonies care for their wounded and sick. \u2013 Swami Vishwananda \u2013 2017-11-26T04:38:22.520\n\n1@hobbs. Fanger only treats evolutionary theory as a 'supposition' and asks when, according to that supposition (which Fanger does not necessarily accept), morality began to evolve. I'm inclined to agree with an answer below that this is not directly a philosophical question but a philosopher might wish to deny (I don't) that morality is the kind of sensibility or disposition that could emerge from a purely biological process. The point would need arguing, however. \u2013 Geoffrey Thomas \u2013 2017-11-26T14:48:07.233\n\n13Am I the only one here that finds the statement in the title really provocative, if not outright offensive? How can you say that there is no sufficient evidence for evolution? \u2013 user000001 \u2013 2017-11-26T15:53:01.850\n\n4Evolution is \"true\" in the same sense as every other theory (Relativity, Newtonian physics, Peano-Axioms in maths) is \"true\". Morality furthermore isn't something biological, so isn't subject to evolution (in the darwinian sense) in the first place. The difference between evolution and e.g. GR is that we can experiment with GR to create more confidence in it, while we can not experiment with evolution without access to time travel or an ability to speed up time significantly. The premise of your question seems to be on very thin ice. \u2013 Polygnome \u2013 2017-11-26T16:35:15.327\n\n1@user000001. The theory of evolution is founded on a single pillar of scientific evidence, namely, the observation of genetic information being destroyed. It doesn't, however, explain the origin of anything at all except for that which occurs by random processes, but many have tried to use it to explain the origin of just about everything no matter how daunting the estimated odds would have had to have been for such random events to occur. There is absolutely no evidence whatsoever to backup this kind of abuse of the evidence. \u2013 None \u2013 2017-11-26T16:39:34.660\n\n8@P\u00e9deLe\u00e3o Occams Razor suggests nevertheless that it is the correct model. Sciences concern themselves with observing nature and deducing how it works - not why it does. Over a long enough span of time and enough procreation, even low odds come true. I have yet to seen any competing model to evolution that explains as many aspects as well as it does. As long as no such model exists, evolution is the best we got. \u2013 Polygnome \u2013 2017-11-26T16:46:58.140\n\n2What does this question have to do with atheism? \u2013 Richard Tingle \u2013 2017-11-26T18:12:22.597\n\n@Polygnome. William of Ockham was a Christian, so it seem that you're wielding his razor incorrectly. He never would have denied that God is the Creator. \u2013 None \u2013 2017-11-26T18:20:46.163\n\n@P\u00e9deLe\u00e3o You can not speak for him, either.

Evolution has created brains that have decision theory (or more accurately, various heuristics that approximate decision theory) baked in because that's what works, so it is hardly surprising that those brains also exhibit morality. \u2013 Harry Johnston \u2013 2017-11-26T20:13:15.730\n\n3I edited out the \"pushing of personal philosophy\" parts that made the post off-topic here. \u2013 Conifold \u2013 2017-11-27T02:44:19.053\n\nOn your question about altruism, Schopenhauer and many others would say that it is the 'breakthrough of a metaphysical truth'.

I was just trying to clarify what I meant. \u2013 Fanger \u2013 2017-11-28T00:51:35.060\n\n\n\nFirst of all, I'm removing the references to evolution as this has been removed from the OP. The rest of this answer should directly address the relationship between the evolution of the brain, social development and the emergence of morals...\n\nMorals don't evolve (biologically at least); they are more of an emergent property of social development. If humans were essentially solitary animals who came together to mate and then abandoned our young to their fate after birth, our moral development would be severely retarded by modern standards.\n\nSo, a part of our moral development as animals comes from social interaction and the need to form a set of basic rules for conduct within the group that promotes the group over the individual. When hunting in a pack, coordinated attacks on larger prey only work if every member of the pack does what they're supposed to do. This forms the basis of concepts like trust, duty, etc.\n\nThe ability to work as a coordinated team in any form other than (say) an insect 'hive mind' capacity doesn't come to organisms straight off the bat when they get brains, however. The brain has been constantly evolving over a billion years or more, and there are stages to it that allow certain functions.\n\nThe oldest part of the brain is the cerebellum, which (for simplicity) can be described as being a hard-wired electrical system. It deals with autonomic functions like regulating the heart and breathing, etc. as well as controlling instincts like hunger, the need to procreate, etc.\n\nNext came the limbic system, or reptilian brain. This is essentially a chemical system and is the seat of emotions. Why did it evolve? Well, sometimes hard-wired instincts work against you and send you into harms way instead of out of it. Also, sometimes what is good for you is not good for your young and puts the species at risk. Emotions are a simple system that provide some context to any instincts driving you and allow you to override those instincts in key situations, like not going for food if the situation looks like a trap or a good place for an ambush.\n\nFinally, we get to the cerebral cortex, which (again for simplicity) can be described as a soft-wired system and is also known as the mammalian brain. This is where our seat of reason is, allowing us to create our own programming to suit a changing environment and allows us to adapt to it within a single lifespan.\n\nIt is this last part of the brain that allows us to ignore our emotions and our instincts if we believe there is a sufficiently compelling reason to do so. The other two parts operate in a purely 'selfish' fashion, based on the idea that our own survival means by extension the survival of our species. The cerebral cortex however allows us to cooperate with others and operate within a social framework even when that may not be the best outcome for ourselves.\n\nIn humans, we've evolved a sense of empathy as well, and this is at the heart of our moral framework. In an attempt to use strategy rather than strength to hunt, we've developed the ability to put ourselves in the prey's place and figure out what it would do next. In so doing, we can plan a trap that the animal's neural programming will make it just walk into, meaning that we can hunt far larger creatures than us armed with little more than a brain.\n\nThe problem is, that empathy has made us acutely aware of our own innate selfishness and the damage that we cause in hunting. We don't refer to our meat by the animal name, we have other names for it like Beef or Pork. We praise ourselves for our sense of sacrifice to each other and to our children especially without giving any thought as to whether we're going too far in not looking after ourselves. (I'm not saying that this is a bad thing, what I'm saying is that our society has evolved to 'expect' us to sacrifice for our children with no further rational discussion on the topic.)\n\nThat we have language and formal constructs of reason only means that we can articulate these concepts far more precisely and call them 'morals', but technically any creature with a cerebral cortex and a social structure is capable of some form of morals, even if they can't articulate them to us.\n\nEmotions and Biological Evolution\n\nTo address comments, the evolution of emotions and (later) reason is improbable, but eminently practical at the same time. Yes, there is a high energy cost to evolving new systems on top of the cerebellum, but they do give organisms something that conventional evolution cannot; contextual awareness.\n\nThe cerebellum can handle situational awareness (There's food over there) and even self-awareness (not sentience, more like 'I'll go to the food because I'm hungry) but what it can't do is help with contextual awareness (I'll save this food for my chick...) or empathy (because it'll be hungrier than I am). Also, there is the contextual awareness of previous experience to consider (I'm thirsty but I'll go to the next waterhole because two of our herd have been taken by a predator at this one).\n\nWhat emotions and reason give life is the ability for a single organism to adapt to its changing environment, rather than having to do it the old fashioned biological way involving many generations. This gives a MASSIVE boost to survival odds, but does leave us combating our 'instincts' far more often at the same time. This can have mixed results (which is what I was getting at previously with the hunting analogy) but generally speaking, our survival odds are much greater with emotions and reason than without.\n\nTo your point about emotions and evolution; we generally believe that all creatures from reptiles up (this includes mammals and birds) are capable of emotions to some degree, perhaps not complex emotions but emotions nonetheless. Mammals for the most part are capable of some form of reason, but it's only humans that can articulate those emotions and reasoning skills with the precision that implies higher intelligence. The singular advantage that we have is the ability to pass on MUCH more of our knowledge at a cheaper energy cost through language, meaning that each new generation can build upon much more of the work of the past. Emotional creatures pretty much have to learn their lessons from scratch; this is still an advantage over being driven by instinct, but the human mind and language allows for a much richer and faster development as a species through knowledge transfer.\n\nUltimately though, the development of the Limbic System and Cerebral Cortex change the role of evolution to that of organic evolution, allowing the organism itself to adapt to the context of its environment, and later to adapt its environment to its own needs as we've started to do recently (in the history of the earth at least).\n\nTo that end, I believe that emotions DO have their roots in the physical evolutionary process and are essentially a mechanism designed to make organisms more resilient while evolution strives to catch up with the new environmental imperatives.\n\nTim B II\n\nPosted 2017-11-26T01:04:39.157\n\nReputation: 1 547\n\nYou're just begging the question. Natural selection does not account for the origin of what is to be selected. The only answer available to the evolutionist is that the origin of everything results from random natural processes. However, there is not a single scientific theory that purports to reduce emotions to any property of matter or energy whatsoever. Therefore, not only is there no basis for the claim that emotions evolved, there is also no basis for claiming the origin of human sentiment or morality is the result of any natural process at all. \u2013 None \u2013 2017-11-26T11:18:11.893\n\n8@P\u00e9deLe\u00e3o Actually, emotions can be induced and reduced through drugs and medication, and perhaps even detected, so, yes, there is science that says emotions are a property of matter and energy.

Reductionists do not care for such objections, however, since in the same sense heat does not reduce to kinetic energy of molecules. Reliable correlation is good enough for them, and one can talk about evolution of emotions/consciousness even if they were emergent relative to physics as non-reductive materialists assume. \u2013 Conifold \u2013 2017-11-27T00:05:03.893\n\nThanks for this Conifold; it helps me understand the deeper question. The problem I have with category error thinking is that it implies that categories are both objective and static, or that everything in existence can be boiled down to belonging to a category that has existed since the big bang which I can't believe. Also, the knowledge I claim to have is only possible because of the way I conceptualise what I see around me, meaning that it's by definition subjective. Still, lots of common subjective realities don't make an objective one. \u2013 Tim B II \u2013 2017-11-27T00:17:00.743\n\n5The opening paragraph is, at best, deeply misleading, if not out-and-out wrong. Science calls evolution a theory because that is what science calls any explanation for observed phenomena\u2014there is no greater, stronger classification that evolution could \u201cgraduate\u201d to if some \u201ctest\u201d were available. Evolution is a \u201ctheory\u201d\u2014like gravity, relativity, magnetism, and so on, literally every single thing we think we understand about reality. We cannot say evolution is proven\u2014because \u201cproof\u201d is not something science as a whole can ever offer. No scientific theory ever will be \u201cproven.\u201d \u2013 KRyan \u2013 2017-11-27T00:51:12.377\n\n@Kryan; I'm not convinced of this. The whole point of science is to observe, hypothesise, and test. We refer to Quantum Electro-Dynamics (QED) as that and not QED Theory because Richard Feynman made observations, developed testable hypotheses, which he then tested. Respectfully, there is a difference in science between 'proven' and 'certain'; I agree that QED (for instance) isn't certain, but it's definitely proven. In order to prove QED wrong, I'd have to put something better in its place. In that sense, I can prove a theory, but because it could one day be replaced it's never certain. \u2013 Tim B II \u2013 2017-11-27T01:01:47.123\n\n2@TimB QED generated some predictions. Later, some observations were made about the world that matched these predictions. Since we haven't made any observations that don't match QED, we accept QED as a principle for now. This doesn't mean it's not a theory though. It's just one that matches all the available data. Evolution is in the same category. It makes some predictions about the past. We then observed some evidence about what happened in the past. The evidence matches the predictions, so we accept evolution for now. The only difference is the ability to generate new observations on demand. \u2013 John Doucette \u2013 2017-11-27T04:40:53.470\n\nJohn, That QED is considered a principle does seem to indicate that there is a graduation from theory at least; theory + observations consistent with theory = principle. The inability to generate new observations in evolution is a pretty big difference, too. All I'm saying is that outside of this discussion, I've only heard the word theory universally applied to two scientific concepts; evolution and the Big Bang. Both I accept because of the weight of evidence, but it is impossible to conduct experiments on either. I understand your point but we don't attach the word 'theory' to principles. \u2013 Tim B II \u2013 2017-11-27T05:06:20.227\n\nAgreed. The use of the word \u201ctheory\u201d in science is inconsistent. Sometimes it refers non-experimental predictions, which can be extremely accurate, and in which people often have a high degree of confidence. (Of course all theoretical techniques ultimately derive some axioms from experimental observations). Sometimes it merely refers to some overarching framework, however experimentally proved. I\u2019ve heard people talk about \u201cthe theory of plate tectonics,\u201d for example. Other times it does conform to popular usage, and refers to something unconfirmed. \u2013 Obie 2.0 \u2013 2017-11-27T05:53:59.610\n\n1@TimB: there is no \"graduation\". A theory is a theory and that's all it will be. When a theory's predictions are accurately tested, this of course inspires confidence in it, but it doesn't make the theory anything new. Newtonian Mechanics were \"fact\" for centuries until suddenly they weren't, due the Theory (note the name) of Relativity. \u2013 Martin Argerami \u2013 2017-11-27T06:01:33.037\n\nMartin, that at least implies there's some ambiguity in the use of the term in science; the 'theory' of relativity completely supersede the 'laws' of motion as set forth by Newton. For what it's worth, I understand the point. A theory is always a theory. But, when there is experimental proof, it would seem to be something more also, so it's not ALL it will be because otherwise, we wouldn't refer to some of them as laws and some as principles and there'd be no point in experimentation. Personally, I think we're all getting stuck on the wrong point - evolution is fact no matter what we call it. \u2013 Tim B II \u2013 2017-11-27T06:29:21.443\n\n\"Theory\" tends to be thrown around even by scientists. https://philosophy.stackexchange.com/questions/47043/why-does-science-carry-so-much-weight-in-philosophy-when-it-is-highly-fallacious/47078#47078\n\n\u2013 Daniel Goldman \u2013 2017-11-27T10:24:50.830\n\n1I appreciate the effort of finding corresponding sources.

Thanks for the +1 too. \u2013 Tim B II \u2013 2017-11-27T22:55:45.750\n\n\nGood question; I'm extremely interested in understanding the origin of things like morality, politics and war, whether they have an evolutionary origin or not.\n\nFirst, note that the term evolution can be a little confusing. There's organic or genetic evolution, the process by which organisms change between generations and evolve into new species. But we can also speak of the evolution of behavior, ideas and culture. For example, people's behavior has changed (evolved) radically over the last couple centuries.\n\nSo we might ask if morality is a function of organic evolution, the evolution of ideas or a combination of the two.\n\nYou already mentioned two of the (theoretically) primary foundations of morality - 1) the need for social organisms to regulate their behavior and 2) caring for young.\n\nHowever, you then say giving a coin to a beggar is pointless and is a behavior that therefore shouldn't have evolved.\n\nHierarchy of Morality\n\nIt's important to note that there's a hierarchy of moral behaviors. Just about every living human (as well as most other animals) is focused primarily on self-preservation. Our second loyalty is to our relatives, especially our young. We may also display loyalty to clans, villages and nation states. Ultimately, our biological \"goal\" might be said to be the preservation of the species.\n\nFor example, imagine you're hiking in the woods when you see someone attacked by a bear. What's the point of getting involved? If a person is killed by a bear, it's no big deal in the big scheme of things.\n\nYet most people would instinctively rally to protect another human from a wild animal or any other force of Nature. In fact, the desire to protect our young commonly overrides our instinct for self-preservation. It isn't even unusual for people to risk their lives to save total strangers.\n\nIt's possible that the instinct to give money to beggars is somehow connected to this instinct to look after our species.\n\nMorality 201\n\nAnother possibility is empathy, which Tim B mentioned. Many people experience feelings of \"guilt\" when confronted by less fortunately people. Such people may give money to the most hopeless beggars, if only to make themselves feel better.\n\nYet another factor is public relations. Even people with no inclination to give money to a beggar may do so merely to convince other people that they're righteous.\n\nSo your beggar analogy is really fairly complex. The good Samaritan could be motivated by a number of things, and people might also argue whether helping beggars is of any practical benefit. In fact, some might even argue that it is immoral.\n\nHumans Only?\n\nUltimately, pinpointing the precise origin of morality depends largely on how we define the term. Concepts like morality, philosophy and war are commonly attributed to humans only. Which begs the question, what is a human?\n\nWe were not the first species to make tools and harness fire. One could make a strong case that we inherited morality from an ancestral species.\n\nBut we could take it a step farther. Primates aren't the only creatures that mourn or even bury their dead. Domestic dogs are renowned for their often fanatic loyalty to their masters.\n\nEven if we don't classify such behaviors as morality, it's likely that morality has roots in such behavior.\n\nDavid Blomstrom\n\nPosted 2017-11-26T01:04:39.157\n\nReputation: 1\n\nThe comments section is not for arguing about worldviews.

I'm really confused on how did collective wellness came about when the fittest survive? Interspecies competition should overcome intraspecies competition because animals in the same species share the same niche, or is there an intuitive enmity between species? Actually, my real question would be why did organisms become more and more complex but that's not a philosophical question. \u2013 Fanger \u2013 2017-11-28T00:18:22.177\n\nOf course there are missing links; there are missing links in virtually all sciences. And if you really meant THEORY, then you must be talking about the way evolution works, because evolution as a general principle is regarded by the scientific community as a fact. I'm not sure why organisms become more complex, but here's a logical answer: The odds against an elephant suddenly emerging out of the primordial ooze was rather remote. It makes much more sense that the first life forms were extremely simple - so simple, in fact, that they couldn't get much simpler. \u2013 David Blomstrom \u2013 2017-11-29T00:19:07.667\n\n@Fanger: You should not think Darwinism in a historical scope that narrow: Evolution happens over the course of several, oftentimes hundreds of, generations. And only if species members with certain properties are not (or way less often) able to procreate, e.g. because they have problems finding suitable nutrients. At any given time, there is no evolution. It is a process extending over a long time-span. Effectively, one could say that probably there have repeatedly been alterations in genes that produced more complex life over millions of years that happened to work out quite well. \u2013 Philip Kl\u00f6cking \u2013 2017-11-29T17:59:26.907\n\n\nThis is more of a biology, psychology, or anthropology question, rather than a philosophy question. However, I suppose philosophy can be used to integrate concepts from any field.\n\nMore importantly, you have already biased the question to a disbelief in evolution. Is evolution true? I really do not know. However, it is the most robust body of theory we have on the origin of species, and we have theory on how we evolve biologically and culturally (the selfish gene is of course a common source for discussions about how culture can evolve). This dual sense of evolution is important for your question.\n\nNo Innate Morality\n\nHumans do not seem to have built in morality. Anthropologists have studied morality in numerous cultures and there seems to be little that is universal. Even in the areas that are universal, there are differences. For instance, as far as I can tell, every culture has a sense of \"immoral killing\" i.e. murder, but what constitutes murder can be very different. For one culture, any killing of another creature, not even just humans, is murder, while in another culture, you can shoot someone who slept with your wife, with a poison dart, and watch them slowly die and that's completely okay.\n\nBuilt in Framework\n\nHowever, morality itself is a universal. We all have a sense of right and wrong. But we are not born with it. Instead, it seems that we have evolved the mechanics necessary to form morality, just as we have evolved to be able to learn language. Our brain can process facial expressions. It can tell whether or not someone else is in pain. One could call this a moral compass, but at birth that compass needle is not yet magnetized. Only through enculturation will it become magnetized, and each culture's \"north\" will be different.\n\n\nThe biological framework for morality evolved over millions of years. We see the origins of such a framework in our close relatives. Any social animal needs some kind of mechanism to get along with others in the group. But if we are not born with a programmed moral compass, how do morals themselves arise? Any shared and learned pattern of behavior can evolve. We see this with the game of telephone. We see this with family traditions. Maybe a tradition started out as a necessity, and as it was learned it just became part of the process.\n\nCultures are under selective pressure, just as biological species are. If a cultural trait is harmful, the society which practices it will have a more difficult time competing with those societies that do not have it. Similarly, there may be cultural norms or values which give an edge over other societies.\n\nThis idea helps make sense of certain prohibitions in religious texts. Why is premarital sex prohibited? Well, for one thing, there was little birth control, so people would get pregnant and in a complex society random births without any attached lineage is a problem. However, sexually transmitted disease was another issue. There was no form of protection against them. A culture which abstained from premarital sex would therefore reasonably have a lower rate of STDs and would be more likely to thrive.\n\nWe now have birth control and medical technology that helps cure or prevent STDs in many cases. We also have testing so that we're aware of the infection and can inform our partner(s). Therefore the selective pressure against pre-marital sex is lessening and we are seeing an increase of such behavior.\n\n\nThere seemed to be a question about the origin of morality. Well, how does any cultural element come into being? Some may be remnants from our earlier instinctual behavior, which became encoded in culture as we evolved from being primarily motivated by instinct to being primarily motivated by learned and shared behavior. Some elements can arise simply from attempts to answer a question.\n\nWhether or not to kill is question that is going to be asked when there are conflicts between people that can turn violent and deadly. How that question ends up being answered depends on the situation, but once answered, that answer can propagate through society.\n\n\nSo we have biological evolution which has developed the innate components of the moral framework, and which was originally responsible for instinctual behavior. Through stochastic processes and natural selection on cultural, we have evolved cultural morality. Random situations, variations in existing behavior, etc act as the source for the morals which are then selected.\n\nAdditional Material\n\n  \u2022 Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy has a robust discussion on the topic of cultural evolution.\n\nDaniel Goldman\n\nPosted 2017-11-26T01:04:39.157\n\nReputation: 842\n\n2Can you provide references for your claims? \u2013 Polygnome \u2013 2017-11-26T17:02:23.303\n\n1I added two citations (one more direct than the other) for cultural evolution.

Second, science is pretty clear that while apes are our closest living relatives, our closest relatives that were distinct biological kinds are extinct. Apart from that: Organisms are not evolving. Species are. Over generations. Important difference. \u2013 Philip Kl\u00f6cking \u2013 2017-11-29T22:45:31.707\n\n\nThere is no conclusive evidence as morals, for most of human history, were a matter of social habits (lat. mores = habit) that were passed through social learning and forms of direct communication (may it be language or others). In other words: There is nothing to base conclusive evidence on to be found by archaeologists.\n\nA possible answer to the title question\n\nJustin Stagl, a cultural sociologist, put it that way (Stagl, J. (2000): 'Anthropological Universality. On the Validity of Generalisations about Human Nature.' In: Being humans: anthropological universality and particularity in transdisciplinary perspectives, Routledge, pp. 25-36. Quote on page 26):\n\nAn early species of the genus Homo, which lived in Tanzania about 1.8 million years ago (and thus for a time contemporaneously with Australopithecus) and is called Homo habilis, used his hands in a secure and goal-oriented way for the fabrication of tools and implements. Homo habilis' thumbs could be directionally opposed to his other fingers, enabling him thus to perform precision grips. Accordingly, his brain capacity \u2014 and as a result, his intelligence \u2014 was one and a half times larger that of Australopithecus, although still merely half of that of Homo sapiens. It is reasonable to assume that the systematic use of tools and implements, including their fabrication, evolved pari passu with some system of communication and tradition, i.e. culture (the first signs of which have been observed among primates). (emphasis mine)\n\nThis would mean that it is reasonable to assume that morals in the contemporary sense of cultural habits of social life were developed by homo habilis as early as around 1.8 million years ago.\n\nSteigl also acknowledges that \"the first signs\" (whatever this may mean) can be \"observed among primates\". This is a bit fuzzy (see third point) and does not at all mean that primates always showed \"first signs\", but leads us to the question of the relational connection between primates and Hominidae as an interesting aside.\n\n\n\"Today we no longer speak of the 'missing link', but instead of the 'connecting link', which defines for us the transition from more or less arboreal primates (the Pongidae, J.S.) to the bipedal Hominidae (anthropoids, not to be confused with the genus Homo; minimal definition: Hominidae are bipedal primates).\" Seidler goes on to explain that such a \"connecting link\" was actually found in 1992 in Ethiopia: Ardipithecus ramidus was a \"very apelike Hominid\", who lived 4.4 million years ago and who was already capable of bipedal locomotion, whilst still feeling at home on trees (Seidler 1997). (ibid, pp. 25-6)\n\nThis means that the family of Hominidae parted ways with primates around 4.4 million years ago and it took another 2.6 million years to develop (the biological prerequisites of) morals.\n\nMorality in non-human animals\n\nFor some more accounts of the evolution of morality, see: de Waal, F. (Ed.). (2014). Evolved morality: The biology and philosophy of human conscience. Brill: Leiden.\n\nAs Conifold points out in a comment below, one could say that it is not only in humans that morality evolved. For some more recent insights about how \"natural morality\" and the problems of the is/ought divide can be addressed, see the above-mentioned book, pp. 49-68. de Waal argues there that morality evolved in primates as well and describes how they show moral behaviour. He stresses some differences that may disqualify this behaviour as \"moral\" in the eyes of others, though:\n\nOther primates do not seem to extend norms beyond their immediate social environment, and appear unworried about social relationships or situations that they do not directly participate in. They also may not, like humans, feel any obligation to be good, or experience guilt and shame whenever they fail. We do not know if other animals experience such \u2018ought\u2019 feelings. One could argue that their behavior is normative in that it seeks certain outcomes, but that animals manage to do so without normative judgment. They may evaluate social behavior as successful or unsuccessful in furthering their goals, but not in terms of right or wrong. (ibid, p. 64).\n\nPhilip Kl\u00f6cking\n\nPosted 2017-11-26T01:04:39.157\n\nReputation: 9 269\n\n\nAs I recall, transmission of useful habits through social communication (\"culture\") is observed in other higher mammals (e.g. dolphins), and even in social insects. Konrad Lorenz famously called mechanisms of inhibiting lethal aggression against own kind displayed by social animals \"behavioral analogies to morality\". There is a case to be made that \"morality\" is not exclusive to primates and perhaps evolved independently multiple times, e.g. Morality as a Biological Phenomenon\n\n\u2013 Conifold \u2013 2017-12-03T22:22:15.713\n\n\nBefore providing a full answer to this question, your conjecture that evolution is not backed by sufficient evidence to be considered true is lofty at best. The only reason evolution is not considered a scientific law has to do with the tight set of constraints scientists set upon what can be considered a law. Though there is ample evidence to support evolution, independent evolution is not a theory which can be tested without hundreds of thousands of years of direct observation. Lucky for us, there are several millions of years of fossils which we can observe and which do support independent evolution, and artificial selection to prove it as a biological concept.\n\nHaving resolved that,\n\nThe assertion that morals ever had to evolve is not entirely accurate nor is it backed with sufficient argument in your question. Though the brain did evolve through evolution, the social constructs humans accept and label to be \"morals\" did not. The most basic parts of the brain, the cerebellum and limbic system, are what we can consider \"selfish systems\". Their purpose is to ensure the survival of a singular organism, that being the one which they are a part of. The more complex cerebral cortex, however, is where we can see complex behaviors such as those you label to be \"moral\". Argue as you will about what morality means, but what morality is essentially stems from the human capacity to have empathy. Empathy is a byproduct of a very complex hunting behavior which allows humans to take on creatures which are considerably larger and stronger than it by understanding the creature being hunted. Effectively, humans can place themselves in the position of their prey, allowing them to create things such as traps. This same concept also causes humans to understand the damage they do in hunting, and the damage they do in any situation involving harm to another being.\n\nHaving established the basis of empathy, we can continue to observe more concrete evidence as to why morality is not a concrete and universal principle, but rather is fluid based upon the person. Take the example of murder. Pretty much every functional human who is not the victim of a mental disorder can recognize that killing another human being is wrong. The vast majority of America, though, would readily consent to and support the concept of war.\n\nDallas Crenshaw\n\nPosted 2017-11-26T01:04:39.157\n\nReputation: 106\n\n2The evolutionist assumes that there is no such thing as a nonmaterial soul, and he observes his own emotions and thus concludes that emotions are a property of matter. As much as people would like to talk about brain chemistry and limbic systems, our emotions don't even remotely resemble any properties of matter that they teach in chemistry class. Therefore the conclusions that emotions are a property of matter is based on assumption that matter and energy are all that there is. And without this huge leap of faith, all these arguments here fall to the ground. \u2013 None \u2013 2017-11-26T20:45:35.023\n\n2@P\u00e9deLe\u00e3o I'm afraid you've made a grave logical flaw. You assert here that I make an assumption about emotions by confining them to \"matter and energy\" because I apparently assume they are all that exist. Those, however, are not assumptions, but perfectly reasonable grounds upon which to base something. If you'd like to prove that there is something beyond either matter or energy, feel free to do so. But do not make the mistake of putting the burden of proof on me to prove that there is not something beyond matter or energy; it is not my responsibility to do so. \u2013 Dallas Crenshaw \u2013 2017-11-26T21:17:05.230\n\nI'm not seeing the \"logical flaw\" that you're referring to. I should also add that not every evolutionist necessarily makes that assumption, but that's usually the case. And there's no need to get hung up over the word assumption. Call it a premise if you like, but it's not a premise that I share. And I also never mentioned burden of proof. My point is that it depends on a premise which can't be proven, and I'm quite sure that it's false. There's even a number of atheist who recognize the inadequacy of our current understanding of matter to account for these things. \u2013 None \u2013 2017-11-26T21:25:19.890\n\nLooking at it from my perspective, the human soul plus the limbic system still provide the same evidence in the lab. However, the phenomenal properties of consciousness and emotions can be accounted for because I'm not trying to force them onto chemical compounds where they don't belong. Therefore, my worldview harmonizes with science much better than yours does. \u2013 None \u2013 2017-11-26T21:34:49.803\n\n2@P\u00e9deLe\u00e3o The logical flaw is that your entire argument is based around your own assumption that there is something beyond matter and energy. Granted, there may well be, of sorts. But it isn't at all the thing you think of if it exists at all. You made no mention of the burden of proof, but that has nothing to do with whether or not you attempted to put the burden of proof on me to prove that something doesn't exist, which is an impossible thing to do. It is not my job to prove that there isn't a soul such as the one you refer to; it's your job to prove that there is. \u2013 Dallas Crenshaw \u2013 2017-11-26T21:43:36.113\n\n@P\u00e9deLe\u00e3o I'd also quite like to know what \"inadequacies\" that view point suffers from. Though complex, consciousness and emotions are both properties of the brain. It would seem the only problem here is your inability to understand them. As far as I can tell, your entire view point of attributing both consciousness and emotion to something beyond what is physical is just you refusing to believe that what you perceive to be something simple can have such incredible results. \u2013 Dallas Crenshaw \u2013 2017-11-26T21:58:56.747\n\n\nOrganisms evolving to adapt to their environment is evident but to another species is not (https://www.activist-news.com/darwinism-lack-proof/), don't assume it as a fact.\n\n\u2013 Fanger \u2013 2017-11-28T00:21:38.860\n\n@Fanger That makes no sense. The question is about what the scientific theory of evolution has to say about when morality evolved. Any answer that is on topic is compelled to presume it as fact; to not do so would be to not answer the question. \u2013 H Walters \u2013 2017-11-29T17:07:23.473\n\n@HWalters, I don't hold that view, I just asked out of curiosity to see if Darwinists have any good points to offer. \u2013 Fanger \u2013 2017-11-29T21:08:32.000\n\n@Fanger I understand that; I've no problems with you not holding that view, or asking the question out of curiosity about the answers. But I think you're confusing what s.e. is all about. This is a Q&A site, not a forum. It wouldn't be appropriate to use comments or answers to this question to try to convince you that evolution is true. For the same reason, it's inappropriate for you to question the presumptions required to answer the question. We're not trying to invite debate here; we're trying to collect relevant answers to interesting questions. \u2013 H Walters \u2013 2017-11-30T05:07:29.077\n\n...for example, were I to ask on Christianity s.e. about the theological basis of the trinity doctrine, I'm inviting the answers to presume trinitarianism. Whether or not I am a trinitarian, or even a Christian, or the person answering is either, shouldn't matter. The question simply being what it is invites the presumption, because that's what's required for an answer. \u2013 H Walters \u2013 2017-11-30T05:09:33.910\n\n\nMorality didn't evolve by natural selection at all. Morality is knowledge about how to make choices. Being able to make choices requires understanding that there are different ways you could behave. As such, morality doesn't arise at all without the ability to create explanatory knowledge. The ability to create explanatory knowledge gives rise to a new evolutionary process where culturally transmissible behaviour (memes) undergo variation and selection. Memes have a generation time of the order of one second. A set of memes also doesn't have to be capable of producing a working body every time it is instantiated, so memes can be selected to satisfy different criteria than evolution by natural selection. For the best available account of memes see \"The Beginning of Infinity\" by David Deutsch, Chapters 15 and 16. We are the only known species that we know of that can create explanatory knowledge and so the only species that has created morality.\n\n\nEvolution selects among genes not organisms or groups. Genes are passed on, organisms and groups are not. So genes can be changed by selection since they can be selected, groups and individuals can't. Social organisms look after one another because they share genes, see \"The Selfish Gene\" by Dawkins.\n\n\nSome memes get copied because they do something useful - rational memes. For example, some ideas help people create scientific knowledge, e.g. - statistics. Other memes get copied by preventing a person from using his ability to criticise and replace ideas - anti-rational memes. In any individual case, giving money to a beggar may be a result of a rational or anti-rational meme. A rational reason to give to a beggar might be to help him become productive and do stuff that will help you. The idea that you owe some random person on the street a living is an anti-rational meme. A person might be poor because he has shitty ideas that keep him poor, so trying to give him a living wouldn't work. So the answer is \"it depends\".\n\n\nPosted 2017-11-26T01:04:39.157\n\nReputation: 6 821\n\n\nThere's no point in time where bacteria, or apes, or neanderthals, or summerians switched to a behavior under the rules of morals.\n\nMorals are a set of informal and non-coercitive rules that allow individuals in a society to live together. In other words, we can survive as a group only due to morals. Ethics are the same, but formalized and non-coercitive. Law is the same, but formalized and coercitive.\n\nTherefore, we can say that bees follow a social behavior that would be comparable to the one determined by morals in the sense that it allows the group to survive. Bees bring resources to the nest for all individuals, and their primary source of food aren't other members of the group. Just as we do, while we call it morals.\n\nThen, morals, ethics or law are just sets of rules promoting group existence and persistence. They are a foundational aspect of the features of the human species that evolved and persisted natural selection. Animals or plants would have equivalent features.\n\n\nPosted 2017-11-26T01:04:39.157\n\nReputation: 2 572\n\n\n(This is a challenging question, but the highly upvoted answers, though correct, are annoyingly long. I am going to try not to write a book.)\n\nWe like to think of morality in social terms because we are social animals, and because we have spent most of our lives trying to learn how to get along with one another. But a toddler knows better. They are angry when the toy they want does not come into their grasp, and that outrage is not deductive or simply wishful or expressive of any less rigorous sentiment -- it is moral.\n\nSo at its base, morality is a mode of logic, it contains all the kinds of statements that indicate what should happen to make us feel OK with the world.\n\nThis kind of 'statement' originates as soon as something has needs and makes decisions in an attempt to fulfill those needs. Morality is the basis on which we decide whether an action is worthwhile, and whether or not to pursue it. The fact that 'worthwhile' is so often about reward and punishment, or pride, guilt, and regret, for humans is somewhat accidental to us. This more basic form is present in the simplest species that make those decisions. This extends at least back to bacteria.\n\nYour second question is very distant from there.\n\nA lot has been said about the evolution of altruism, but the cleanest workable theory is that it is at root a 'virtue signal' for general intelligence. To break it down stepwise and somewhat oversimplify:\n\n1) Exchange of helping behaviors is mutually beneficial.\n\n2) Keeping track of them one can note that what you give comes back to those about whom you care. So generosity to one's local social circle pays off\n\n3) Not keeping track of them indicates a lack of concern with the supply of resources, because a family structure that does not hold account between its members pays off by reducing the stress of uncertainty among its members, but only if the family itself is generally successful.\n\n4) Generosity encodes confidence in one's social structure, which correlates with having a resourceful family, which correlates with being a resourceful provider oneself.\n\n5) Appearing not to limit your generosity advertises your intrinsic virtues and lets you breed 'up'.\n\nSo, in general, this kind of morality becomes a sign of genetic, and therefore social value.\n\n\nPosted 2017-11-26T01:04:39.157",
