    "output": " Metaparse has a rich set of parser combinators, that allow you to describe the same grammar in a more effective way.\n\nMetaparse is primarily designed to be used in C++ programs. However, there is a Haskell binding available too. It uses the same interface and can be used from Haskell. The Haskell binding can be found at\n\nMetaparse is written in C++98. It is designed to be usable even in environments that support only C++98.\n\nThe implementation of the parser library is designed to be used in C++11. It uses constexpr to improve the performance, however, it falls back to using template metaprogramming when C++11 is not supported.\n\nMetaparse provides a number of examples of how to use the library. You can find examples demonstrating how to use the library in various ways, including the usage of constexpr and the generation of native code.
