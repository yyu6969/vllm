    "output": "\n\n\nHi @Jhansi\n\n  1. For your first question, if you pass the argument steps=2500, the final batch of 14 images will be ignored. You can check how many batches you need by dividing the number of samples you have by your batch size. So in this case 79726 / 32 = 2491.4375 and therefore you have a remainder of 14 images.\n\n  2. As for validation, I\u2019m not sure how you would do it as the dataset isn\u2019t available on Kaggle anymore. But I would suggest you to take a subset of your test data (say 5000 images) and manually check the accuracy of those images.\n\nHope this helps.\n\n(Jhansi) #159\n\n@aniket thank you so much. Am trying with steps = 2500 and it is running. But my another doubt is, will it effect my prediction if i left the 14 images?\nAnd regarding second part, i didn\u2019t get it. Can you please elaborate, why i have to check the accuracy of 5000 images manually?\n\n\n  1. You won\u2019t have a huge impact on your predictions as you are only ignoring 14 out of 79726 samples.\n\n  2. Since the test dataset doesn\u2019t have any labels, you can\u2019t validate your predictions in the traditional sense. So what I meant was, you can pick a sample of your test data (5000 images in this case) and manually assign labels to them and see whether your model is able to predict them correctly. This will give you a rough idea of how well your model is performing.\n\n(Jhansi) #161\n\n@aniket Thank you so much for your kind suggestions. Am going to try it as you said. And it was very helpful. Thank you so much.\n\n(Jeremy Howard) #162\n\nYou don\u2019t have to worry about the test set, as it\u2019s not available any more :slight_smile: You can look at the public leaderboard scores, and just make sure that your model performs well on the validation set. Then your submission will likely do ok.\n\n(Paulo Marques) #163\n\nI have a question regarding the training process of the State Farm competition.\nI trained a simple CNN model on the training set, but when I evaluate the model on the"
