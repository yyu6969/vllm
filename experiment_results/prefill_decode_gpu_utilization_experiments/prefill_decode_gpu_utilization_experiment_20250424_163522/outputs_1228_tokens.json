    "output": " It is an iodine compound that is taken up avidly by thyroid tissue. Because patients who have had thyroid cancer have areas of functioning thyroid tissue left behind after surgery, I-131 accumulates in those sites and destroys them and any accompanying cancer cells. Another intravenous approach is Y-90 microsphere therapy, which can be injected into the hepatic artery, supplying blood to the liver, where the microspheres get trapped and emit beta radiation directly into the tumor. This is done with relatively little damage to the surrounding liver tissue. Yttrium-90 is also used to treat leukemia and lymphoma, and in sentinel lymph node biopsy. It may be used in combination with a monoclonal antibody to direct the radiation specifically to the desired target.\n\nRadiation Sources Used in Teletherapy and Brachytherapy\n\nRadiation sources used in teletherapy include:\n\n  \u2022 Cobalt-60 teletherapy units\n  \u2022 High-energy megavoltage linear accelerators\n  \u2022 Low-energy orthovoltage x-ray machines\n  \u2022 Proton beams\n\nRadiation sources used in brachytherapy include:\n\n  \u2022 Radioactive iridium (Ir-192)\n  \u2022 Radioactive cesium (Cs-137)\n  \u2022 Cobalt-60\n  \u2022 Palladium (Pd-103)\n  \u2022 Gold (Au-198)\n  \u2022 Strontium (Sr-90) and Yttrium (Y-90)\n  \u2022 Iodine (I-125) for permanent implants\n  \u2022 Phosphorus (P-32) and Yttrium (Y-90)\n  \u2022 Yttrium-90 labeled monoclonal antibodies\n  \u2022 Radioiodine (I-131) used in thyroid cancer treatment and in radioimmunotherapy (RIT)\n  \u2022 Indium-111 labeled compounds for detection of occult disease and metastasis\n  \u2022 Technetium-99m labeled compounds for detection of occult disease and metastasis\n  \u2022 Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging\n\nRadiation sources used in brachytherapy may also include radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies.\n\nFor brachytherapy, the radiation source may be placed inside the body, close to the tumor, or on the skin. These techniques are used when the radiation needs to travel only a very short distance ("

Dec 8, 2005 #21\n    Thanks Doodle Bob.\n    I tried it out using:\n    t = gamma t'\n    d' = gamma d\n    d = 2 000 000 ly\n    t' = 50 years\n    v = 0.99995c\n\n    Then I solved for t (using the gamma values), added that to 50 years and got a value of 2 million years. Is this right? Thanks again for the help.\n  23. Dec 8, 2005 #22\n    i don't see how you got v = 0.99995c\n    how did you find that?\n\n    i'm guessing you used the time dilation formula,\n    t' = \u03b3t, where t' is the time on the ship, and t is the time on earth.\n    you're right, i suppose, since \u03b3v \u2248 1 for speeds that are nearly the speed of light. (i.e., time dilation is large).\n\n    it is worth noting that the distance traveled on the ship is contracted. the distance is contracted by the same factor as time dilates. so the trip seems like 50 years because of time dilation, and the distance to andromeda is only 2 light years because of length contraction.\n\n    so the ship travels 2 light years in 50 years, giving a speed of c/25.\n  24.
