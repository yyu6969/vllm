    "output": "This approach is used when you need to wait for something to happen before you continue execution. Hope that helps. Regards!\n\nUpdate: To avoid using addEventListener, you could use this pattern:\n\nfunction restart_game() {\n    setTimeout(do_game, 0);    \n\nsetTimeout function will run do_game function only after all other tasks from current stack are done (like setting style attribute). It's very common pattern to use when you need to delay code execution until some operation is completed.\n\nMore info on Event Loop here.\n\nAnother example of setTimeout usage:\n\nvar arr = [];\nfor (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n    setTimeout(function () {\n    }, 0);\n\nThe result will be an array [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] as setTimeout will wait until the for loop ends before it starts pushing values to arr. Without setTimeout it would output [10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10] because setTimeout callback would start immediately as soon as i = 10. The difference between the two is that in one case you're setting a timer and letting the loop finish before executing the callback, while in the other case you're creating 10 callbacks, each waiting to be executed at the next possible moment. So even though the time-out is set to 0 milliseconds, you're still waiting for the other callbacks to be created first. setTimeout allows you to defer execution of your callback until later, but not necessarily right away. The engine will always take that into account and won't schedule a task for execution immediately, regardless of its timeout value. This is a behavior of the event loop. You can read more about it here. Hope that clears things up! :) Regards! Update #2\n\nHere's another solution using Promises. If you're familiar with ES6, this might help you:\n\nfunction restart_game() {\n    var myPromise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n        myBody.style.backgroundColor = \"rgba(255,255,255,1)\";\n        resolve(do_game()); // this will call do_game() and return the value it returns\n\n// or\n\n// or\n\n// or you can use then method to chain multiple promises\nmyPromise.then(function(val){ console.log('do_game result:', val)"

First, if you are going to use pruning shears, loppers or a saw to remove the broken branches, make sure that these tools are very clean before using them. You can sterilize them with rubbing alcohol or a solution of one part bleach and nine parts water. Next, you can protect the open wounds on the branches and trunk by applying a non-drying tree wound dressing such as PVA glue. This will prevent insects and pathogens from entering the tree. You might also want to mulch the base of the tree with 3-4 inches of wood chips or shredded leaves, which will help protect the root system and conserve moisture. If your tree is young, keep grass and weeds from growing within a two foot radius of the trunk. Finally, be sure to water the tree when the soil is dry, especially if it has been windy, hot and dry for several days.\n\nAnswered on October 23, 2008\n\n\nRelated Questions\n\nSee Also\n\nHelpful Tools & Forms \u00a0 Tell us what you think! \u00a0 Ask us a Question\nAsk Us A Question!\nAsk about Gardening and Landscaping\n\nWe'll do our best to give you an answer\n\n(Required but will not be displayed)\nEnter the text in the image:"
