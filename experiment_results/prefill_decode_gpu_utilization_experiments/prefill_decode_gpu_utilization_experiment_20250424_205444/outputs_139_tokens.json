    "prompt": "A one-year insurance policy pays $10822 if the policyholder dies within one year. The premium paid by the policyholder is $351, and the probability of death within that year is 0.006. What is the expected gain of the policy for the insurance company?\n\n1 Answer\nApr 13, 2018\n\nThe expected gain is #$286.07#.\n\n\nThe expected gain for the insurance company is the revenue for the policy minus the cost for the policy\n\nThe revenue for the policy is $351.\n\nThe cost for the policy is the expected value of the benefit of the policy.\n\nThe expected value of the policy is the amount that the policy pays times the probability of paying.\n\n\nexpected gain = revenue #-# payout #xx# probability of payout",
    "output": "\nexpected gain = $351 - $10,822 #xx# .006\nexpected gain = $351 - $64.93\nexpected gain = $286.07\n\nThe expected gain for the insurance company is #$286.07#. This means that on average the insurance company will make this much on each policy. However, the expected value does not account for the variance in outcomes. Some years the insurance company will make more than this, and some years they will lose money. Over many years, however, the average gain for the company would"

    "prompt": "How are factors and products related?\n\n1 Answer\nMar 19, 2018\n\nFactors are what you multiply to get a product.\n\n\nIn a multiplication problem, there are two types of numbers. Factors, and products. Factors are going to be #color(green)(green)# and products are going to be #color(red)(red#.\n\n\nThat is how factors (what you are mulltiplying) and products (what you end up with) are related.",

    "prompt": "Which one is correctly matched?\n\n[wp_quiz id=\u201d14284\u2033]\n\nThe correctly matched pair is AIDS virus-Reverse transcriptase.\n\nAcquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome is caused due to the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in humans. HIV is a retrovirus belonging to the family Retroviridae. The genome of HIV consists of two single-stranded positive-sense RNA enclosed inside a capsid.\n\nTo replicate its RNA, HIV uses an enzyme called Reverse transcriptase. The enzyme Reverse transcriptase generates complementary DNA (cDNA) using the viral RNA as a template. The process of synthesis of DNA from RNA is called Reverse Transcription.",
    "output": " Thus, reverse transcriptase is specific to retroviruses.\n\nThis enzyme was first discovered by Howard Temin and David Baltimore independently in 1970. They received Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1975 along with Renato Dulbecco for their discoveries concerning the interaction between tumour viruses and the genetic material of cells. In 1983, Robert Gallo claimed that he had isolated the HIV virus in his laboratory, which led to his discovery of the enzyme Reverse Transcriptase.\n\nOption A: Correct answer\n\nOption B: Incorrect as Hepatitis B virus does not require reverse transcriptase for replication.\n\nOption C"
