    "prompt": "Exam2 - Movement/Support + Perfusion Flashcards Preview\n\n1st Semester Nursing > Exam2 - Movement/Support + Perfusion > Flashcards\n\nFlashcards in Exam2 - Movement/Support + Perfusion Deck (117):\n\nDorsal to ventral, what is the order of the spinal cord coverings?\n\nDura mater\nArachnoid mater\nPia mater\n\n\nHow does spinal anaesthesia differ from epidural anaesthesia? How are they similar?\n\nThey are both analgesics (pain relief) and anaesthetics (numbing).\n\nEpidural location is the fatty epidural space between dura and dorsal vertebrae. A catheter is threaded and it\u2019s hooked up to a continuous drip.\nEpidurals medicate afferent nerves. They do not enter the spinal fluid.\n\nThe spinal anaesthetic location is in the subarachnoid space. It is an injection (no drip) and wears off in two hours. It enters the space with spinal fluid.\n\n\nWhich nerves are afferent and which are efferent? (Dorsal vs ventral)\n\nDorsal nerves are afferent (sensory relay to brain)\nVentral nerves are efferent (motor relay to body)\n\n\nWhat does RANK-L do? Who releases it? What initiates its release?\n\nRank ligand. Activates bone resorption by attaching to RANKL receptors on osteoclasts.\n\nReleased by osteoblasts.\n\nWhen blood calcium levels decrease, parathyroid gland releases PTH, which tells the osteoblasts to release RANKL.\n\n\nWhat is OPG and what does it do? Who releases it? What initiates its release?\n\n\nIt supports bone formation by attaching to RANKL so it can\u2019t attach to osteoclasts. Prevents osteoclasts from resorbing and allows osteoblasts to build bone.\n\nReleased by osteoblasts.\n\nIts release is initiated by testosterone, estrogen, and weight-bearing exercise.\n\n\nWhat effects do low blood calcium levels have on osteoblasts and/or osteoclasts?\n\nParathyroid gland releases PTH in response to low Ca++ levels.\n\nPTH stimulates RANKL release by osteoclasts.\n\nOsteoclasts resorption releases Ca++ into bloodstream.\n(PTH release slows when Ca++ levels rise).\n\n\nWhat effect do high blood calcium levels have on osteoblasts and/or osteoclasts?\n\nWith high blood Ca++ levels, the thyroid releases Calcitonin, which tells osteoclasts to stop resorption activity.\n\n(PTH release will also slow).\n\n\nWhat is RANK?\n\nRANK is the receptor for RANKL (found on osteoclasts)\n\n\nWhat are the risk factors for osteoporosis?\n\n**Post-menopause (low estrogen=low OPG release)\nInsufficient dietary Ca++ before age 30\nPoor Ca++ absorption\nVitamin D deficiency\nExcess caffeine/nicotine/alcohol\nInadequate weight-bearing exercise\nEndocrine disorders (like excess PTH)\n\n\nWhere is osteoporosis most likely to occur?\n\nIn porous parts of bone, like the femoral neck of the trochanter, the wrist, and the thoracic and lumbar spine.\n\n\nWhat are the three types of fractures we talked about and any risks associated with them?\n\nClosed fracture\nOpen fracture (broken skin = increased risk for infection)\nPathologic fracture\n\n(Note: if any of the above are breaks fo the femur, there is a high risk for blood loss leading to hypovolemic shock).\n\n\nWhat is compartment syndrome and why does it happen?\n\nInflammatory response can lead to fluid increase/swelling, that puts pressure on arteries, veins, nerves, muscle in the compartment.\n\nIt can happen if a hard cast is put on a broken limb too soon, or inside the abdomen (unrelated to casting).\n\n\nWhat signs and symptoms are associated with compartment syndrome?\n\nSwelling, skin color change (pallor), signs of occluded blood supply on other end of cast:\n-decreased SpO2\n-decreased cap refill\n-decreased pulse strength\n-decreased sensation (due to hypoxic cell injury)\n\nMonitor circulation, motion and sensation.\n\n\nWhat are the types of spinal cord injuries we talked about that can lead to spinal shock? Are they primary or secondary neurologic injuries?\n\nConcussion: (violent shaking of brain tissue or spinal cord tissue up against bone. From force of acceleration, deceleration, or rotation).\n\nContusion: (bruising of neural tissue)\n\nThese are all primary neurologic injuries.\n\nLaceration: (tearing of neural tissue)\n\n\nWhat is transection and why isn\u2019t it associated with spinal shock?\n\nTransection is a complete severing of the spinal cord. There will be total and irreversible loss of function below the level of the cord injury.\n\n(Spinal shock is temporary)\n\n\nWhat is a secondary neurologic injury?\n\nWhen spinal blood flow is obstructed due to an inflammatory response. The obstruction leads to ischemia and necrosis of neural tissue.\n\n\nWhat is spinal shock and why does it happen? Is it a primary or a secondary neurologic injury?\n\nA temporary loss of function due to swelling around the nerves in the spinal cord. (Despite the word \u201cshock,\u201d has nothing to do with vascular supply).\n\nMast cells detect concussion/contusion/laceration and begin the inflammatory process.\n\nSpinal shock is a secondary neurologic injury - it is due to swelling.\n\n\nWhat are dermatomes and what are some ways we use them?\n\nDermatomes mapped out sections of the body that correlate with spinal nerves.\n\nWe use them to test for sensation at different levels:\n-C3/C4 on side of neck\n-T6 at nipple line: critical level for neurogenic shock/failure of vital processes. Monitor for patients with an indwelling epidural cath. If loss of sensation rises to T8/T7, get a BVM an a provider.\n\nShingles: location of skin blisters tells you where in the nerve fibers varicella is acting up. Provider can give cortisone shots along the nerve route to treat.\n\n\nWhat is the most common cause of lower back pain?\n\nAcute lumbar disc herniation due to poor body mechanics.\n\nHerniation in towards the spinal cord puts pressure on the capillary beds there.\n\nLocal ischemia d/t occluded blood flow. Mast cells detect and send out chemotactic factors to initiate inflammatory response.\n\n(Slide says most low back pain is idiopathic).\n\n\nWhat is degenerative joint disease?\n\nAlso called osteoarthritis. It occurs in load-bearing synovial joints. Excess wear and tear leads to degradation of cartilage. Bone rubs on bone, leading to inflammation. Sometimes associated with crepitus (crunching sound from bone fragments in joint)\n\nBiggest risk factor is a BMI greater than 30.\nAge also increases risk d/t decreased cartilage\nAlso, joint stress/trauma\ngenetic & environmental factors\n\n\nWhat is Rheumatoid Arthritis?\n\nAutoimmune condition where your adaptive immune system attacks the synovial membrane, thinking its antigens are foreign invaders.\n\nChronic inflammatory process in joints leads to fibrotic scarring. Synovial membranes experience hyperplasia, developing nodules called \u201cpannus\u201d that are most visible on surface joints. Limit movement.\n\n\nDescribe the immune process behind rheumatoid arthritis\n\nRheumatoid factor attaches to the synovial membrane cells, initiating the inflammatory response.\n\nNeutrophils and Macrophages start to phagocytize damaged tissue.\n\nMacrophages present the antigen to CD4 cells\n\nCD4 cells connect with naive B cells and initiate their differentiation into plasma & memory B cells.\n\nLots of antibodies produced against synovial cells.\n\n(A positive test for rheumatoid arthritis will reveal elevated levels of rheumatoid factor).\n\n\nWhat is the primary symptom of Gout? What causes it?\n\nRed swelling, pain, and eventually a hard nodule called a \u201ctophi\u201d in the big toe.\n\nCaused by uric acid crystals that form in the synovial fluid and slightly lower temps of the toe.\n\n-Uric acid can accumulate because of hyperuricemia (elevated blood uric acid levels). Decreased kidney function, high purine diets, conditions with rapid cell turnover and repair (like burns) can increase risk.\n\n\nWhat gives cartilage its cushioning characteristics and why doesn\u2019t it heal? What happens instead?\n\nCartilage attracts water, which helps to cushion loads.\n\n-chondrocytes don\u2019t proliferate\n-don\u2019t receive nutrients through a blood supply, but rather through diffusion.\n\nCartilage is prone to calcification:\n-calcified cartilage can\u2019t properly diffuse nutrients\n-this leads to swelling and death of chondrocytes\n-eventually, bone will replace cartilage.\n\n\nWhat can you do to promote bone repair/growth?\n\nChange your diet:\n-extra Ca++\n-extra protein\n-vitamin D\n-antioxidants to combat any inflammatory ROSs from damage.\n\nAvoid: nicotine, excess caffeine, alcohol\n\nAdd weight-bearing exercise to increase OPG release.\n\n\nWhat is a soft callus?\n\nForms when bone has been damaged and is in the process of regrowing (osteoblasts). Includes new blood vessels and collagen (thanks to macrophages).\n\nWeight-bearing in the first 2-3 weeks of bone repair can cause deformities.\n\n(The soft callus will become harder, but the bone won\u2019t fully heal for about 4 months)\n\n\nWhat leads to scoliosis and why do people have surgery to correct it?\n\nIt\u2019s due to genetic factors and occurs during rapid growth in adolescence.\n\nSurgery consists of the severing of all muscles, placing in traction, total spinal fusion, titanium rods and screws.\n\nCorrective surgery is because the curvature in the spine can put pressure on the lung tissue leading to shortness of breath, and pressure on the heart, leading to low cardiac output.\n\n\nWhat happens to sensory input once it arrives at the brain?\n\n-Motor cortex (in cerebrum) interprets & determines response\n-Sends message to thalamus\n-Thalamus (sensory relay center) interprets both incoming and outgoing messages\n\n\nWhat do we need to know about the basal ganglia?\n\nCluster of cells in and around the thalamus that release dopamine.\n\n(Dopamine inhibits excess movement and smooths out good movements).\n\nThese are the cells that atrophy in Parkinson\u2019s, decreasing dopamine and resulting in a resting tremor and other movement control issues.\n\n\nWhat do we need to know about the cerebellum?\n\nHome of the Reticular Activating System (RAS) - a cluster of nerve cells that helps regulate movement.\n\n\nProblems in which areas of the brain can lead to coordination and movement issues? What sort of problem might cause that?\n\nMotor cortex (cerebellum)\nBasal ganglia\n\nHemorrhagic stroke is one of the problems that can damage these areas.\n\n\nWhat are some motor dysfunctions related to tone?\n\nHypertonia: too much muscle tone - leads to stiff, difficult to move muscles.\n(Can result from blocked efferent messages - muscles tighten due to disuse)\n\nHypotonia: Low muscle tone, many times with reduced strength.\n\n\nHow does muscle tone differ from strength?\n\nTone is observable in activities like sitting, turning, general ADLs.\n\nStrength relates to the ability to push, pull, lift, etc.\n\n\nWhat type of motor dysfunction is related to strength?\n\nParesis: muscle weakness but normal tone\n\nPlegia: paralysis\n\n\nWhat type of motor dysfunction is related to movement?\n\nHyperkinesia: increased muscular activity, resulting in excessive abnormal movements (like tremors in Parkinson\u2019s)\n\nHypokinesia: Abnormally decreased muscle movement (slow gait in Parkinson\u2019s, or difficulty in initiating movement).\n\n\nWhat is the most common cause of hypotonia in infants?\n\nLack of oxygen to the brain in the birth process leads to hypoxic cell injury to the brain. Creates motor cortex problems (no motor output).\n\n\nWhat is disuse syndrome and how does it relate to limited mobility?\n\nInability to move around leads to a deterioration of body function/systems.\n\n\nWhat does nitric oxide do? What medication do we give for MIs that mimics its effects.\n\nNitric Oxide (NO) causes arteries to dilate, improving blood flow.\n\nWe give Nitroglycerin during MIs because it has the same effect.\n\n\nWhat do free radicals have to do with NO (nitric oxide) production? How do we combat their effects?\n\nThe enzyme that produces NO gets highjacked by free radicals and changes it so it produces MORE free radicals.\n\nDue to free radical damage, arteries will stiffen and become dysfunctional - they won\u2019t relax when they should.\n\nLarge quantities of fruits and vegetables in our diet will use up the free radicals so they can\u2019t hijack this enzyme.\n\n\nHow do Aortic & Carotid Baroreceptors participate in heart rate regulation.\n\nWhat is the response?\n\nStretch receptors that detect a pressure change in the arteries (based on the amount of stretch).\n\nSend signals via connected nerves to the medulla oblongata.\n\nCardiac Control Center in oblongata has a \u201cset point\u201d for blood pressure. It interprets message and sends signals along efferent nerve to bring it back to set point.\n\nIf BP is too high, efferent vagus nerve (PNS fibers) to SA node, releases ACH and inhibits/slows heart rate. (Notes also say systemic dilation of arterioles and veins).\n\nIf BP is too low, efferent cardiac nerve (SNS fibers) - releases Norepinephrine and increases heart rate.\n\n\nA patient has broken his wrist. Which cells will the mast cells summon during degranulation?\n\nPhagocytes: neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages.\n\n\nYour patient with the broken wrist has mast cells that will synthesize platelet-activating-factor. How is this going to help repair his bone?\n\nIt signals the liver to release clotting factors - both fibrinogen and platelets are activated for response.\n\n\nWhich WBC promotes angiogenesis?\n\n\n\nWhat are 3 ways that macrophages help to repair broken bone?\n\n1. Clean up debris at site (phagocytosis). Stay a while because it can replicate.\n\n2. Grow a new blood supply so area can heal.\n\n3. Release cytokines - promote collagen and callus growth.\n\n\nA fibrin mesh is being laid down at a broken bone injury site. How did the clotting cascade get started?\n\nMast cells synthesized platelet activating factor.\n\nThis signaled the liver to release clotting factors and fibrinogen.\n\n\nWhat should you tell your broken-bone patient about diet and activity?\n\n1. DO eat calcium, vitamin D and protein.\n\n2. Avoid OPG inhibitors like caffeine, alcohol and nicotine.\n\n3. Avoid weight bearing exercise during soft-callus formation.\n\n\nWhat scenarios are going to create excess preload?\n\n\nValve regurgitation\n\nVentricular hypertrophy\n\nNa+/H2O Retention in cases of excess aldosterone\n\n\nWhich scenarios will cause increased afterload?\n\nHypertension (systemic vascular resistance)\n\nAortic rigidity\n\nAortic valve stenosis (narrowing of aorta)\n\n\nWhat condition (preload or afterload) will ventricular hypertrophy increase?\n\nIncreased preload\n\n\nWhat condition - preload or afterload - would excess aldosterone production increase?\n\n\n(Excess aldosterone leads to excess water retention, which would lead to hypervolemia)\n\n\nValve regurgitation is going to increase what - preload or afterload?\n\n\n\nA patient is presenting with shortness of breath (especially when lying down), crackles in lungs, dependent edema and JVD. What are these symptoms of?\n\nIncreased preload.\n\n\nWhat is the main physiological change that will occur with chronic increased afterload?.\n\nL. Ventricular hypertrophy.\n\n\nWhat can a patient do for himself to decrease preload?\n\nDecrease sodium in diet (decrease fluid volume)\n\nDaily weights\n\nFluid restrictions\n\n\nWhat can a patient do to help decrease his afterload?\n\nReduce stress\n\nSupport thermoregulation (assuming this is for adequate warmth) to promote vasodilation\n\nWork on fluid balance.\n\n\nWill elevated PTH decrease or increase OPG levels?\n\nIt will decrease OPG production.\n\n\nWill elevated TNF (tumor necrosis factor) increase or decrease RANKL levels?\n\nTNF increase will increase RANKL levels.\n\n\nWhat effect does estrogen have on RANKL production?\n\nRANKL isn\u2019t produced as much when estrogen levels rise. (Additionally, OPG is produced more).\n\n\nWhat does TNF (tumor necrosis factor) have to do with osteoporosis?\n\nAn increase in osteoclasts activity activates cytokines which actually leads to inflammatory responses.\n\nTNF is activated in the process.\n\nTNF will further enhance osteoclasts activity.\n\n(If this is happening while OPG levels are decreasing/decreased, you have an imbalance of homeostasis and you will get more bone loss.)\n\n\nWhich bones are at highest risk for fracture secondary to osteoporosis (ie, pathological fracture)?\n\nTrochanter of hip\n\n\nIs aldosterone fat-soluble or water-soluble?\n\nFat-soluble. (-osterone)\n\n\nIs ADH fat-soluble or water soluble?\n\n\n\nWhat organ does aldosterone come from, and what activates its release?\n\nAdrenal gland. Activated by Angio II.\n\n\nWhat organ does ADH come from\n\nPosterior pituitary gland - activated by 3 different things:\n\n1. Angio II tells the posterior pituitary to release.\n\n2. SNS response (fight or flight response)\n\n3. Dehydration (sensed by hypothalamus, tells the post-pit to release)\n\n\nWhat response does Aldosterone produce in its target cells?\n\n-Causes cells in nephron to retain sodium (from urine filtrate) and excrete potassium.\n\n(This causes water to follow sodium, retaining water.\n\n\nWhat response does ADH create in its target cells?\n\nIt causes endothelial cells in periphery to vasoconstrict\n\nIt causes cells in nephron to reabsorb water (opens aquaporins) to it can go back to bloodstream.\n\n\nWhat is the overall effect of aldosterone on the body?\n\nSodium retention \u2014> water retention\nPotassium excretion\n\n\nWhat is the overall effect of ADH on the body.\n\nVasoconstriction increases BP\nWater retention increases BP (due to increased volume)\n\n\nWhat type of patient situation would cause the body to release aldosterone?\n\nDrop in BP - sensed at the kidneys as a decrease in renal perfusion.\n\n\nWhat causes the body to release ADH\n\nDehydration and/or low perfusion pressure around the hypothalamus.\n\nStimulation of the SNS\n\nDrop in BP at the kidneys.\n\n\nWhat is the job of the RAAS? What are its two triggers?\n\n-regulate fluid balance\n-regulate arterial blood pressure.\n\n-increase in SNS activity\n-Decrease in blood pressure (specifically MAP) at the JGA cells - presents to kidney as a decrease in renal perfusion.\n\n\nHow does Renin become Angio II?\n\nRenin + Angiotensin (Liver) = Angio 1 + A.C.E (lungs) = Angio II.\n\n\nWhat four things does Angio II stimulate?\n\nEndothelial cells (AT2 receptors): Vasoconstrict\nPosterior Pituitary: Release ADH\nKidneys: Resorb sodium and potassium\nAdrenals: release aldosterone.\n\n\nHow does Angio II\u2019s effects on the kidneys differ from Aldosterone\u2019s effects on the kidneys.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t. Both tell the kidneys to resorb water and release potassium.\n\n\nHow does Angio II\u2019s effects on the kidney differ from ADH\u2019s effects on the kidney?\n\nAngio II makes kidney cells resorb sodium and release potassium.\n\nADH makes kidney cells open aquaporins and absorb water.\n\n\nWhat is the normal MAP range? How do you calculate it?\n\nNormal: 65-110\n\nCalculate it by: (Systolic-Diastolic)/3= pulse pressure.\nTHEN, pulse pressure + diastolic = MAP.\n\n\nWhat is the definition of preload? Where does it come from?\n\nThe load on the heart before a contraction begins\n\nComes from the combined volume of:\n-the ejection fraction (amt of blood remaining in ventricles at diastole/relaxation)\n-the amt of blood entering ventricles (vena cava for R. Ventricle and Pulmonary vein for L. Ventricle)\n\n\nWhat effect is excess preload going to have on the entering blood vessels?\n\nR. Ventricle?\nL. Ventricle?\n\nIt will cause overflow.\n\nR. Ventricle: into the vena cava leads to JVD and edema in peripheral tissues (especially the ankles and sacrum).\n\nL. Ventricle: into the lungs via the pulmonary vein. Leads to fluid in the lungs (crackling) and cough + difficulty breathing while lying down.\n\n\nWhat is afterload? What is it determined by?\n\nThe amount of force the ventricles need to exert to move blood into the aorta and into the lungs.\n\nDetermined by the amount of resistance in the arteries and/or the lungs.\n\n\nWhat are two potential causes of increased afterload to the Right Ventricle? (One acute, one chronic?). What is the resulting damage/effect?\n\n-Pulmonary embolism (acute): Blood clot in the lungs. (Probably originating from DVT). Damage to the R. Ventricle, which keeps pumping, trying to overcome pressure.\n\n-Lung Tumor or COPD (chronic): Chronic increased afterload (Resistance) to the right ventricle results in a hypertrophy of right ventricular muscles, which leads to a decreased intraventricular radius and decreased preload.\n\n\nWhat is a cause of increased afterload to the L. Ventricle? What is the effect?\n\nAtherosclerosis: plaque buildup in blood vessels will create resistance as the L. Ventricle tries to pump throughout the body.\n\nL. Ventricular hypertrophy, decreased interior size, decreased cardiac output.\n\n\nWhat pressures are involved in perfusion homeostasis?\n\nHydrostatic pressure: Pushing pressure from the systolic - force fluid generates while pushing against the capillary wall.\n\nOncotic pressure: Pulling pressure on the venous end from serum albumin. Retrieves fluid from the tissues in the capillary bed.\n\n\nWhat cellular problems might come about from insufficient systolic pressure (decreased CO)? What are the signs/symptoms?\n\nInsufficient pressure means:\n-decreased nutrients to tissues (O2 and glucose)\n-decreased ATP production (pump failure)\n-sodium accumulation in cell and hydropic swelling\n-cell lysis/hypoxic cell injury\n\n#1 sign: change in mental status due to metabolic acidosis\n-cardiac dysrhythmias (d/t hyperkalemia?)\n-increased respiratory rate (d/t acidosis)\n-increased temp (d/t inflammatory response?)\n\n\nWhat can cause a decrease in oncotic pressure? What happens if it\u2019s local? Systemic?\n\nCan be caused by:\n-Histamine release as part of the inflammatory process (antigen presence). This releases albumin from the vascular space into the tissues: not enough pull back into the bloodstream.\n\nIf localized - yay! Fibrinogen/clotting platelets will block off area.\n\nIf systemic - Decrease in blood volume = SHOCK (septic shock or anaphylactic shock).\n\n\nWhat is the definition of Shock? (Anything but spinal shock, that is).\n\nCirculatory system fails to meet the perfusion demands of cells, tissues and organs. In other words, severe HYPOPERFUSION.\n\nCauses cellular hypoxia.\n\n\nWhy would shock cause a vicious cycle of \u201cworsening\u201d shock?\n\nHypoperfusion leads to cellular injury.\nInflammatory response.\nVasodilation and endothelial cell retraction.\nDecreases oncotic pressure to draw blood back in to vascular system.\nFurther decreases BP/volume/perfusion\nFurther decreases ATP production, cellular injury.\n\n\nWhat are the body\u2019s compensatory responses to shock?\n\n-Increase in heart rate (cardiac center responds to decreased baroreceptor stretch in SA node)\n-Constriction of blood vessels (epinephrine and norepinephrine) to increase venous return for vital organs.\n\nRenin Release (with purpose of increasing blood volume, and therefore Blood pressure - measureable by urine output).\n\n\nAre body\u2019s compensatory measures to shock long-lasting? What effects will they have?\n\nNo. Eventually they will decrease tissue perfusion and O2 supply.\n\nUltimately, you\u2019ll have cell injury (ATP pump failure, hydropic swelling and lysis, free radical formation). This creates systemic acidosis, hyperkalemia, and widespread inflammatory response. Multiple organ failure can result.\n\n\nWhat do you suspect for a patient exhibiting a change in level of consciousness.\n\nSuspect shock (resulting acidosis changes LOC). Elevate legs, turn head to side, put blanket on them.\n\n(Legs up assists with blood to vital organs)\n(Blanket assists with hemoglobin release of O2.)\n\n\nWhy do we NOT do Trendelenburg for shock victims?\n\nIt increases vascular pressure at the heart, stimulating a PNS response (via CNX10) to release ACH, which will tell SA node to further decrease heart rate.\n\n\nWhy are catecholamines, growth hormone and cortisol released when the body is in hypoperfusion? What is the ultimate effect?\n\nThey\u2019re a result of SNS stimulation - they increase heart rate, increase vasoconstriction and strengthen contractility to compensate.\n\nBut, they decrease glucose uptake by the cells. This leads to gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis and lipolysis.\n\nThese process not only require energy, but the result in lactic acid buildup, which contributes to acidosis.\n\n\nHow does acidosis affect Hemoglobin?\n\nThe lower the pH, the more tightly the O2 will bind to the Hb molecule (The less likely it is to release it for cells).\n\n\nWhat is cardiogenic shock? What is the primary cause?\n\n-Heart muscle can\u2019t output enough blood to supply tissues.\n\n-#1 cause: myocardial infarction (blocked coronary artery, usually due to atherosclerosis). The blocked artery will prevent delivery of O2/glucose to a portion of the heart and damage/kill heart muscle.\n\nDamaged muscle means decreased inotropic function (strength of contractions).\n\nDecreased inotropic function means decreased stroke volume (30-40ml).\n\nBlood accumulates as end systolic volume, increases PRELOAD.\n\n\nWhat is a normal stroke volume?\n\n60-80 mL\n\n\nHow will cardiogenic shock present?\n\nJVD distention and pulmonary edema from preload backup.\n\n-Pain in chest, radiates down arm.\n-Decrease in MAP\n-Decrease in systolic pressure w/ normal diastolic\n-Decrease in urine output (compensatory)\n-Change in LOC\n\n\nWhat is obstructive shock? What is the primary cause?\n\nSomething blocks the flow of blood - most commonly in lungs, where it reduces the return of oxygenated blood to the left ventricle.\n\nNot enough blood in left ventricle means not enough blood to pump to body.\nRight ventricle continues to pump despite resistance - gets a backup of blood.\n\n#1 cause - pulmonary embolism (Clot from DVT travels to lungs and occludes arteriole and nutrient supply to lung tissue.\n\n\nHow does obstructive shock d/t pulmonary embolism present?\n\nSudden onset chest pain\nGasping for air\nHemoptisis (coughing up blood)\n\n\nWhat is hypovolemic shock? What things are most likely to cause it?\n\nSevere hypoperfusion due to loss of blood/fluid (15% or 900+mL).\n\nMost likely from hemorrhage or excessive dehydration.\n\n\nHow does the body compensate for hypovolemic shock?\n\nActivates the RAAS.\n\n\nWhat will hypovolemic shock present as?\n\nDecreased MAP & BP\nIncrease in HR\nCool, clammy skin (due to vasoconstriction)\nDecreased urine output (due to RAAS activation)\nChange in level of consciousness (often beginning as apprehension, agitation, and restlessness, then later decreased arousal, then loss of consciousness). (Due to acidosis).\n\n\nWhat is neurogenic shock? What causes it?\n\nA loss in blood vessel tone due to overstimulation of PNS or understimulation of SNS\n\n(Blood will pool in extremities - no venous return).\n\n\nWhat are the cardinal signs of neurogenic shock?\n\nWarm, dry skin\n\n\nWhat is anaphylactic shock? What causes it?\n\nWidespread vasodilation and endothelial cell retraction causes loss of vascular volume into interstitial spaces. Due to an immune-mediated allergic response (systemic mast cell degranulation releases histamine everywhere).\n\n\nWhat are the signs of anaphylactic shock? How do you treat it?\n\n-Laryngeal edema (swelling of the airway) leads to bronchospasm: difficulty breathing.\n-circulatory collapse\n-Decrease in BP\n-weak, thready pulse\n\nCan start as:\n-abdominal cramps\n-warm, burning skin\n-itching, hives\n-respiratory distress (coughing, wheezing, choking)\n\nTx: epinephrine causes systemic vasoconstriction and bronchiole relaxation.\n\n\nWhat is septic shock? What causes it?\n\nLoss of blood volume to interstitial spaces due to systemic immune response (mast cell degranulation & histamine release) to a severe infection (often in the bloodstream).\n\nCommonly, e.coli or other bacterial endotoxins cause it. An indwelling catheter (esp in women) can frequently cause it.\n\n\nHow will septic shock present? How can you test for it? How can you prevent it?\n\nPresents as:\nWarm, flushed skin\n\nPrevention: Catheter care - meatus and away from it, cleaning colonization of bacteria from tube.\n\nTest: Serum Lactate, CRP (opsonins), Procalcitonin (bacteria)\n\n\nWhat are atrial stretch receptors for?\n\nSense stretch due to increased venous return (increased atrial preload).\n\nThey send message to brain to DECREASE pituitary production of ADH (don\u2019t retain any more water)\n\nAnd they release their own ANP (atrial naturatic peptide) that causes the kidneys to excrete sodium, making you excrete more water, too.\n\n\nWhat are the two main reasons for DVT (deep vein thrombosis). How can you help prevent it?\n\nDecreased mobility (blood pooling in legs, decreased venous return)\n\nIncreased hematocrit (blood is too viscous to return). (Norm values 35-50%).\n\nROM exercises for immobile patients.\n\n\nWhat is the difference between primary hypertension and secondary hypertension?\n\nPrimary: genetic cause (90-95% of HTN). Cells don\u2019t make enough NO, which usually causes vasodilation.\n\nSecondary: due to a disease\n-renal disease\n-adrenal gland tumors (increased epinephrine, norepinephrine, and cortisol -which acts like glucose)\n-diabetes (AGES - glucose molecules permanently bind to proteins so endothelial cells can\u2019t make NO).\n\n\nWhat is isolated systolic hypertension\n\nHigh Systolic, normal diastolic, high pulse pressure.\n\nDue to age: worn-out endothelial cells (especially in aortic arch) don\u2019t produce enough nitric oxide. Resistance in aortic arch gets transferred throughout entire cardiovascular system.\n\n\nWhat is an aneurysm\n\nWeakness in an artery due to too much hydrostatic pressure over time.\n\nRupture of an aneurysm \u2014> hemorrhagic stroke.\n\n\nWhat is raynaud\u2019s\n\nVasoconstriction in periphery\nBrought on by cold, stress\n\n\nWhat is thrombocytopenia\n\nPlatelet deficiency - less than 100k.\nLeads to an increased bleeding risk.\n\nIf count is less than 20k, spontaneous bleeding will result - you\u2019ll need a platelet transfusion.\n\nCaused by bone marrow dysfunction, cancer (or treatments), anticoagulants.\n\n\nWhat do our notes say about platelet dysfunction?\n\nPlatelets lose the ability to aggregate properly.\nCan be due to medications (antibiotics, NSAIDS, antihypertensives)\n\nNSAIDS will interrupt the production of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin.\n\n\nWhat does \u2018coagulation dysfunction\u2019 refer to?\n\nBody has enough platelets, but something is preventing them from clotting or promotes abnormally increased clotting.\n\nHemophilia (congenital): carried on the Y chromosome. Liver doesn\u2019t produce clotting factors 8 and 12.\n\nAcquired: Liver disease or vitamin K deficiency.\n\nDIC (disseminated intravascular coagulopathy):\n-triggered by SEPTIC SHOCK\nWidespread activation of mast cells - permeability - all platelets get used up!\nCauses spontaneous bleeding at eyes, nose, movement of joints.\n\n\nWhat is ACTH and when does our body make it?\n\nAdrenocortotropic hormone: part of the SNS response. Tells the adrenals to release epinephrine and norepinephrine.\n\n\nWhat does epinephrine do?

There are people who eat the wax as well as the honey, and in restaurants they used at times to serve honey in the comb. He would like to know if it was a bad thing to eat the comb.\n\nAs to the diseases of bees, he thinks these could not formerly have been as bad as they are today when the bees are over-exploited.\n\nHERR M\u00dcLLER said that eating comb-honey was an idiosyncrasy with some people. Naturally, these are the natural combs and not artificial ones. He does not think that bee diseases are the result of exploitation, but that formerly they were less considered. In those days there were not so many weak stocks and so one was not so much on the look out for them. A disease had appeared in Switzerland from England which had not been known in the past. Herr Erbsmehl thinks this may perhaps be owing to the use of artificial manures, even the flowers sicken as the result of this.\n\n\nWith regard to these two points, one might say it is quite true that the eating of honey-comb is a fancy with some people; the real question is whether it is good for them, and this can, unfortunately only be answered medically. It is only possible to answer this question when one is really able to observe these people who eat the honey-comb, thus the wax, from the point of view of their state of health. I have seen various people who eat the comb, but they always spat it out when they had sucked out the honey. I have not so far come across people who eat any considerable quantity of wax. One should take into consideration that people digest in very different ways, not everyone in the same way. There may be people who would get some kind of gastric trouble simply by eating the wax, and such persons should be advised not to take it. But there can also be people who are able to digest the wax without any trouble and get rid of the residue by excretion. With regard to these people one could certainly say that because they eat the wax with the honey, (thus leaving the honey as long as possible still in connection with the wax which has entered the body), the honey is digested more in the intestines, whereas otherwise it is not digested till it has left the intestines and has passed into the lymphatic vessels. It is a question of the state of health of the person concerned. There are people who digest more in the intestines, and others more in the lymphatic vessels; one cannot say that one way is better than the other, for one is just as good as the other. It depends on the individual. One could only speak with certainty if one took a number of people who eat honey in the comb, and others who eat it without the comb, and then investigated how these two matters are related.\n\nWith regard to bee-diseases the question is, as is usual in disease, namely, that we must take into account what Herr M\u00fcller has just said. It is so even with human beings that certain things were not much noticed formerly, whereas today they are most carefully studied. But here something essentially different comes in question. The bee-keeper of the past had really many good instincts: he did many things without being able to say just why he did them. Today these instincts no longer exist. Today people always want to know the reason why. To determine this why it is, however, necessary to study the whole matter very fundamentally. Modern knowledge is not as a rule in a position to do this.\n\nYou see, the bee-keeper of old had very good instincts as how to treat the bees, I should like to say, in quite a personal manner. For instance, you should consider that there is already a considerable difference between giving the bees the old straw skeps as in former days, and giving them wooden hives as one does today. Box-hives are made of wood, and wood is an entirely different substance to the straw of which the old skeps were made. Straw attracts quite other substances from the air than does wood, so we have already a difference in the external handling. When I add to this all the bee-keeper did in former times, and above all, the strong instincts he had to do them even if he did not always know the reason why, he would, for example, place his bee-hives on some chosen spot, where the wind would blow more often from one quarter or another, and so on. Today one sets the bee-hives wherever there is room for them, from reasons of convenience. The climatic elements are still considered, but no longer to the same degree.\n\nHERR M\u00dcLLER stated that he pays great attention to this; he places his hives on a ridge where they are sheltered from the north wind and the east wind, and so on.\n\n\nIn such matters wood is less sensitive than straw. I have no intention of agitating in favour of straw skeps; nevertheless differences do exist, and just such things as these certainly, very definitely, affect the bees with regard to their inner activities. A tremendous activity goes on in the body of the bee when it must first gather the nectar from the plants, and in absorbing it, transforms it. This is really an immense work. How does the bee accomplish it? It is accomplished through the quite special relationship between the two different fluids in the bee. One of these is the gastric juices and the other the blood-fluid. When you study the bee you find the whitish gastric juice and the reddish sap of the blood; these are the two main elements of which the bee is constituted, and all the other parts are arranged according to the workings of the gastric juice and the blood. The main point then is this definite proportion between these two fluids; they differ very considerably in themselves. The gastric juice is what one calls acid in chemistry, and the blood sap is chemically called alkaline, which means that it is not acid though it can be made so; in itself it is however, not acid. When the pepsin is insufficiently acid, something takes place within the bee which greatly disturbs its inner organism in the honey-producing process. The blood sap is only kept sufficiently strong when the necessary climatic conditions of light and warmth, etc., are present.\n\nIt will therefore be very important to take the right means of establishing the proper balance between the gastric fluid and the blood if one is to overcome the many diseases which have recently appeared among the bees. As bee-keeping can no longer be carried on as in past days, it is no longer possible to arrive at preventive methods through climatic conditions of warmth, etc., for these are no longer able to work so effectively upon the stocks of bees today; one will have to discover what will be able to work most favourably on the blood sap of the bee. It will be necessary in the future that bee-keepers take special care that the blood sap of the bee is rightly provided for. The following is important: you all know that there are years when the bees are obliged to get nectar almost exclusively from trees. In such seasons the composition of the blood sap is endangered, and the bees are much more liable to disease than at other times. It will be necessary in the future that the bee-keeper even contrives a small green-house \u2014 it need not be a large one \u2014 in which he can cultivate those plants which the bees not only like, but must have at certain times of the year. It will be necessary to have at least some small plot of flowers for the bees especially, for instance in the month of May. They will not fail to discover them for themselves whenever the plants they need have failed elsewhere. By this special cultivation of the necessary plants in the neighbourhood of the hives it will be possible to combat these diseases. These are methods I can recommend; I am giving only indications, but they will most certainly prove satisfactory for they are derived from a knowledge of bee-keeping, If they are put to the test you will find that one day they will bear very good fruit for the bee-keeper, for he will find that the diseases of bees can be prevented by these means. But if one is to proceed in a practical way all the connections mentioned above must be taken into account. I have no wish to make assertions; I only wish to say that these things arise out of the whole nature of the bees, and that it would be well to make experiments with especially cultivated plants in seasons when those most needed have failed, either partially or altogether. It should be possible in this way to considerably improve the health of the bees. I am myself quite convinced that these methods will prove successful when one is able to enter once again into these questions with a true understanding of nature. You see, it is not possible to go back to the old methods of bee-keeping. Just as little as there is any need to be reactionary in the realms of politics, or of life, is there any necessity to be a reactionary in any other domain. One must move with the times; but what really matters is that while we leave the old methods we are careful to balance this by something which will replace what we have lost. This is essential.\n\nHERR M\u00dcLLER stated that bee-keepers were already working in the direction of the special cultivation of certain plants. For example, the yellow crocus, which is grown in large quantities for the bees; other plants were cultivated also with similar small yellow blossoms. Indeed, more than this, for a large amount of American clover is now planted; a clover which grows six feet in height and flowers the whole year round. It is cut only in the autumn; till then the blossom is left for the bees. This might also be necessary perhaps?\n\n\nCertainly, such things are no doubt done, but as a rule the right connections are not known. What Herr M\u00fcller had mentioned at first, was excellent and should be continued, but with regard to the American clover that flowers all the year round, this will in future be avoided, for this plant cannot bring about any improvement at all in the blood-sap of the bees; it acts only as a stimulant, and for a very short time. It is very much the same as trying to cure a man with alcohol, the bees are stimulated to more activity for a certain time. The very greatest care should really be taken today not to grow plants for the bees that are totally foreign to them; bees in their whole organic nature are bound up with a particular country. This is very evident, for the bees from different parts of the world differ widely from one another. There is, for instance, the mid-European bee already referred to here, the common domestic bee. The Italian bee again is quite unlike the Spanish bee, and so on. Bees are most strongly bound by their habits to their native country, and one cannot help them in any real way by giving them the nectar or honey belonging to entirely different countries. They have then, so much work to do in their own bodies that there are great disturbances there; the bees are forced to try and adapt themselves, to make their organisation as much as possible like that of the bees over there, in those countries where the clover comes from. Hard facts will prove in time that though such methods may appear successful for a few years, disastrous results will follow. It is quite true as has been said, that so far there are no definite indications of this, but it will none the less occur, and then people must abandon all such methods, or continue them as was done in the case of the vines. You will remember that in the seventies or eighties, phyloxera appeared and is destroying the vineyards of Europe, over immense areas. At the time I was able to study this matter, as I had a very good friend who was a farmer, and who also edited an agricultural paper, and gave much attention to this whole problem. People began to wonder why the American vine appeared immune to this disease. But what did it all amount to? It amounted to this, that the remedies by which the disease could be got rid of with the American vine, could not be used with the same result on the European vine. The consequence was, that even when everyone began to cultivate the American vine, they could succeed in keeping it in health, whereas the European vines died out. The cultivation of the European vine had to be given up altogether; the whole cultivation of the vineyards was Americanised, and everything has been completely changed. This has happened in many places. To think in this mechanical manner is valueless; one must be quite clear that things through their whole nature may be bound up with definite localities, and this fact must be taken into account. Otherwise though some temporary success may follow, it cannot be permanent.\n\nAre there any other questions you would like to ask? Or are all you gentlemen content to eat honey without so much discussion about it? Perhaps some question may occur to one or another of you.\n\nMeanwhile, I should like to say something quite briefly about the nature of this honey-making process of the bees. It is something so really wonderful that there should be these tiny little creatures that are able to transform what they have gathered from the flowers or plants in general, into the honey which is so health-giving, and which should really play a far greater part in the nourishment of men and women today. It is not realised how important the consumption of honey actually is. For example, if it were possible to influence the social medicine of today, it would be discovered that if people about to be married would eat honey as a preparation for the future, they would not have rickety children. Honey when assimilated can affect the reproductive processes, and greatly influence the building up of the body of the child. The consumption of honey by the parents, and above all by the prospective mother, works especially into the bony structure of the child. Results such as this will appear when these questions are considered in their essential aspects. In the place of the trivialities put forward in scientific journals today, it will be asked, when once we have some real knowledge of these things: \u201cWhat is it best to eat at this or that time of life?\u201d \u201cWhat is best at another time of life?\u201d Indeed, gentlemen, this will be of immense value, for the general state of health will then essentially improve, and more especially will this affect a man's vitality. Today people attach very little value to such matters. Those whose children do not suffer from rickets are naturally very pleased, but they do not think very much about it, it is taken as a matter of course. Only those complain whose children are born with rickets. It is just in the case of such most valuable social and medical methods that people remain indifferent, for it is generally taken for granted that such measures are concerned merely with what they regard as a normal condition. They have first to be persuaded that this is not the case. It should, however, be recognised that extremely favourable results would appear in this direction, and I am sure that if it could in this way be realised that through spiritual science it is possible to arrive at such conclusions, people would begin to look towards the things of the spirit. They would do this to a far greater extent than at present, when they are only told to pray that this or that may happen. Truly, gentlemen, these things which can be learnt by the spirit, and which modern science ignores, are such that one is able to know that during the times of betrothal and pregnancy, honey can be of inestimable value.\n\nI have just said that it is a most wonderful thing that the bee should be able to gather substances from the storehouse of nature and then transform them into this honey which is of so great value to human life. You will best understand on what the origin of honey actually rests if I describe to you the sane process in the quite different form in which it appears in those relatives of the bees, if I may call them so, the wasps.\n\nThe wasps do not provide man with honey, but they prepare a substance that can be made use of medicinally, though of a very different kind to that prepared for us by the bees. In the next lecture I will also speak about the ants, but first, will we consider a certain species of wasp. There are wasps that have the peculiarity that they do not deposit their eggs at random, but place them on plants or on the leaves or bark of trees, even into the blossoms of trees. [Drawing on the blackboard.] Here for example is the branch, here an oak-leaf, and the wasp with its ovipositor which is hollow, (the sting would be here) lays its egg in the oak-leaf, or in some other part of a plant. What then happens? Where the egg has been placed the whole surrounding tissue of the leaf is changed; the leaf would have been quite different if the egg had not been laid there. Very good, let us now see what has happened.\n\nThe whole growth of the plant has been affected, and protruding from the leaf, entirely surrounding the little wasp-egg, we find the so-called gall-nut or gall-apple, those little brownish coloured nuts or apples so often seen on trees. They are there because a wasp deposited an egg at this spot, and all round the egg there is this metamorphosed plant-substance which entirely envelops it. The wasp egg would perish if it were laid in any other place; it can only exist and develop because this protective substance encloses it which the gall-wasp steals from the plant. The wasp robs the plant of this substance. You see, the bee lays its egg in the cells of the comb; the larvae develop and emerge as bees, which in their turn steal the substance of the plant, and elaborate it within themselves. The wasp does this at an earlier stage, for in the depositing of the egg the wasp already takes from the plant the substance it needs. The bee, as it were, waits a little longer, the wasp does it earlier. In the case of the higher animals, and with man, the egg is already surrounded with a protecting sheath within the body of the mother. In this instance what the wasp has to take from the plant is provided by the mother. This gall-nut is simply built up from the substance of the plant, just as the chorion is formed as a sheath round the egg in the body of the mother, and is ejected later with the after-birth. You see how close is the relationship between the wasp and the plant. In districts especially rich in wasps one can find trees almost entirely covered with these galls. The wasp lives with the trees; it depends on them, for its eggs would never develop if it could not procure this protective covering from the different trees or plants. These galls have very many and various forms, there are some which do not look like small apples, but are interwoven and hairy, but everywhere the small germ of the wasp is in the centre. At times these galls look like shaggy little nuts. We see how close is the relationship between the wasps and the plants with which they share their existence.\n\nWhen the wasp has matured, it eats its way with its sharp jaws out of the gall-nut, and emerges as a wasp, and after a period of living in the outer world lays its eggs on a leaf or the bark of a tree; the egg and larval stages are always passed through as a living together with the plants.\n\nWell, gentlemen, you may perhaps say \u2014 what has all this to do with the production of honey? It has actually a great deal to do with it, for when such things are observed in the right way one learns to know how the honey was first prepared in nature, and we find once more an instance of how the instinctive knowledge of the people in older times took these things into account.\n\nPerhaps some of you know that in the south, and more especially in Greece, the cultivation of fig trees is of much importance. These are the so-called wild figs which are certainly rather sweet, but there are people with a still sweeter tooth, who wish to have fig trees that bear still sweeter figs than those of the wild trees. What do these people do?\n\nNow just imagine you have a wild fig tree; this wild fig tree is a special favourite with a certain kind of wasp which lays its eggs upon it. Let us picture this tree, and on its branches a wild fig into which the wasp inserts its egg. Now the grower of the figs is in his way a clever fellow; he lets the wasps lay their eggs in the wild figs which he cultivates just for this very purpose. Later this fellow gathers two of these figs, just at the moment when the wasp eggs are not quite fully developed, when the wasps are not yet ready to creep out, and he takes a reed and ties the two figs together so that they are held firmly. And now he goes to a fig tree that he wants to improve, and he hangs the two figs he has tied together, and within which are the eggs of the wasp not yet fully developed, and binds them on to the fig-tree which he wishes to sweeten. And now the following happens: the wasps within the figs feel that something has happened, for the figs which were gathered now begin to dry up, for they are no longer supplied with the sap of the tree, and get very dry. The immature wasp inside senses this, even the egg is aware of it, and the result is that the wasp is in a terrible hurry to come out of the fig. The grower always starts this process in the spring; he first lets the wasp lay its eggs, and in the month of May he quickly gathers the two figs and carries out his plan. The little creature inside thinks, now I must hurry up, now the time has come when the figs dry up. In a terrible hurry the wasp emerges much earlier than it would otherwise have done. If the fig had remained where it was before, it would only have crept out in the late summer; now it must creep out in the early summer with the result that there is a second brood. It lays eggs in the summer which would otherwise have been laid in the following spring. Now these late eggs which are deposited on the tree that is to be further cultivated, do not reach full maturity, they only develop to a certain stage. The result of this is, that those figs into which the second brood has been placed become twice as sweet as the wild figs. This is the method of improving the figs, of making them twice as sweet.\n\nWhat has actually happened here? The wasps, which though they differ from the bees are yet related to them, the wasps take just that substance from the plant which is on the way to become honey. If in the clever way of the cultivator of the fig trees, the figs of the wild tree containing the eggs of the wasp are thrown up and tied so that they remain hanging up there, and if one then is clever enough to induce the wasps to weave again into the tree what they have taken from the other tree, then honey in the form of sweetness is, as it were, filtered into these grafted fig-trees; it enters into the figs in the form of sweetness because the wasps have prepared it in an extremely fine state of dilution; Nature itself has brought it about in an indirect way.\n\nYou see, gentlemen, nothing has been taken away from Nature, the essence of the honey remains within Nature. The wasp cannot prepare the honey in the way the bee does, for its organisation is not adapted to this. But when, by this by-path, it is compelled during the stages of its growth, to carry the sweetness of the honey from one fig-tree to another, the sweetness of the grafted figs can be increased; a kind of honey-substance is then within them.\n\nYou see, gentlemen, we arrive here at something very interesting. It seems that these wasps have a body which is unable to gather the nectar, the honey-substance from Nature, and transform it into honey within itself. But man can bring it about that from one fig-tree to another a kind of honey-making takes place. The bee is therefore a creature that develops a wasp-like body so much further that it is able to accomplish this quite apart from the trees; in the case of the wasp the process must be left within the tree itself. So we must say: the bee retains within itself more of that force which the wasp only possesses at a very young stage, as long, that is, as it is in the egg, or larval state. When the wasp develops further it loses the power of producing honey; the bee retains it and can make use of it as a fully matured creature.\n\nJust think, gentlemen, what it signifies that one can in this way look into Nature's processes, and can say to oneself: within the plants there is concealed this honey, this substance that tends towards sugar-sweetness. It is there; it shows itself, if only one follows the right path; one has only to assist Nature by seeing that the wasp comes at the right moment to the tree that is to be improved.\n\nHere, in our country such things cannot be done, it is no longer possible today. There was once a time in the evolution of the earth when from the wasps, which as long as 2,000 years ago, and indeed, still today, could be persuaded by some clever fellow to produce a second brood as I have described. These wasps crept out and were given the opportunity of laying their eggs in the figs, which were then again and again gathered. Thus, in the course of time, it was possible that bees could be developed from these wasps.\n\nThe bee is a creature which in very ancient times was developed from the wasp. Today one can still see that it is by means of an animal activity, namely that of the wasps, that honey is first prepared in the realms of nature.\n\nSo now, you can also understand how closely related to this is the fact that the bees place their honey in the cells of the honey-comb. This comb consists mainly of wax, and wax is not only necessary in order that the bees may deposit their honey there, for the bee can only produce honey when its whole organism is active in the right way. It must therefore secrete wax.\n\nThe second fig tree in which sweetness arises of itself, is also richer in wax than the wild tree. It differs especially from the wild tree in that it is richer in wax. Nature has herself increased the wax so that the cultivated figs, the sweetened figs, grow on a tree which in a certain way, Nature has made richer in wax.\n\nYou can already see here a model, as it were, for what appears in bee-keeping.\n\nIf you now go to work very carefully, and make a cross-section from the trunk of the cultivated fig tree, you will find, if you look carefully, patterns just like the wax cells of the comb. Within the tree-trunk you find certain growths similar to the honey cells, formed from the precipitated wax of the tree. The tree that is richer in wax uses it in a kind of honey-cell formation.\n\nSo we can say: when we study this special cultivation of the fig trees we discover a kind of honey production in Nature that has not yet appeared openly, for the honey remains within the figs. The bees, if I may so express it, bring out into the open what remains still within Nature in the sweetened figs. Thus, what would otherwise have remained within the tree-trunk, forming there these natural cells, which are only less definite, less substantial than the bee cells, and fade away again, this whole wax and honey-making process is driven up into the figs, so that Nature is herself a bee-keeper. The bees have drawn it forth from Nature and have these processes within themselves.\n\nWhat does the bee then do? The bee deposits its eggs within the hive, and the egg matures there. It does not need to change the substance into a gall-apple, it takes the nectar directly from the plants, neither does the bee need to go to the tree that is richer in wax, for she accomplishes in herself what takes place in the tree-trunk, and deposits in the comb the juices of the plant which she transforms into honey, which in the case of the cultivated tree, remains in the juices of the fig. One can say that what in Nature lies concealed in the tree through the wasps, now happens outwardly, and it becomes clear what it really is that we have before us, when we look into the hive with its marvellously built comb of waxen cells. It is indeed, gentlemen, a wonderful sight, is it not Herr M\u00fcller? A wonderful sight is the artistic construction of these waxen cells with the honey within them.\n\nYou have only to look at it gentlemen, and you will say to yourselves \u2014 the bees with their waxen combs really show us a kind of artistically formed tree-trunk with its many branches. The bee does not need to go to the tree to lay her eggs there, but they build for themselves a kind of picture of a tree, and in the place of the figs growing there, she puts honey into the finished cells. We find, as it were, a copy of the artificially cultivated fig tree which the bees have made.\n\nTruly, gentlemen, this is to look into the very heart of Nature, and realise what can be learnt from her. Men have yet to learn much from Nature, but for this they must first learn to recognise the spiritual in Nature. Without this recognition of the spirit in Nature, one merely stands and gapes, and should one journey to the south and see how those clever fellows there tie the figs together, the figs pierced by the wasps, and throw then up into the trees and bind and fix them there we shall gape as tourists do, even when they are scientific gentlemen, and not know what to make of it, They do not know that he saves the bees their labour, for Nature will put the honey into the figs for him.\n\nIn those countries where figs are plentiful, they are as health-giving as honey, for it is honey at an earlier stage of development that is already in the figs.\n\nYou see, these are things which we ought to know if we are to discuss a matter of such importance as bee-keeping. I believe that by such means we shall in time arrive at points of view of true value.\n\nLast Modified: 14-Jul-2021\nThe Rudolf Steiner Archive is maintained by:\nThe e.Librarian: elibrarian@elib.com\n\nPlease Donate",

In the majority of cases, Navy technicians are expected to troubleshoot and identify faulty components. This chapter, \"Component Testing,\" will acquaint you with alternative methods of testing various components and their parameters. A quick glance at the Navy\u2019s mission and concept of operation explains why we, in most cases, must be able to troubleshoot to the faulty component level. A ship must be a self-sustaining unit when deployed. Storage space is a primary consideration on most ships and a limiting factor for storage of bulky items or electronic modules as ready spares. Therefore, it is practical to store only individual components common to a great number of equipment types. This of course, limits the larger replacement modules available to you during troubleshooting.\nQ-1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Why are most ships limited in their ability to stock replacement modules for repair of electronic equipment?\n\n\nIn equipment that uses vacuum tubes, faulty tubes are responsible for more than 50% of all electronic equipment failures. As a result, testing of electronic tubes is important to you. You can determine the condition of a tube by substituting an identical tube known to be good for the questionable one. However, indiscriminate substitution of tubes is to be avoided for at least the following two reasons: (1) detuning of circuits may result and (2) a tube may not operate properly in a high-frequency circuit even though it performs well in a low-frequency circuit. Therefore, your knowledge of tube-testing devices and their limitations, as well as correct interpretation of the test results obtained, is indispensable for accurate and rapid maintenance.\n\n\nBecause the operating capabilities and design features of a tube are demonstrated by its electrical characteristics, a tube is tested by measuring those characteristics and comparing them with representative values established for that type of tube. Tubes that read abnormally high or low with respect to the standard are suspect. Practical considerations, which take into account the limitations of the tube test in predicting actual tube performance in a particular circuit, make it unnecessary to use complex and costly test equipment with laboratory accuracy. For most applications, testing of a single tube characteristic is good enough to determine tube performance. Some of the more important factors affecting the life expectancy of an electron tube are listed below:\n\u00b7\u00a0 The circuit function of the tube\n\u00b7\u00a0 Deterioration of the cathode coating\n\u00b7\u00a0 A decrease in emission of impregnated emitters in aging filament-type tubes\n\u00b7\u00a0 Defective seals that permit air to leak into the envelope and oxidize the emitting surface\n\u00b7\u00a0 Internal short circuits and open circuits caused by vibration or excessive voltage\nIf the average receiving tube is not overdriven or operated continuously at maximum rating, it can have a life of at least 2,000 hours before the filament opens. Because of the expansion and contraction of tube elements during the process of heating and cooling, electrodes may lean or sag, which causes excessive noise or microphonics to develop. Other electron-tube defects are cathode-to-heater leakage and nonuniform electron emission of the cathode. These common tube defects contribute to about 50% of all electronic equipment failures. For this reason you should immediately eliminate any tube known to be faulty. However, avoid blind or random replacement of good tubes with fresh spares. The most common cause of tube failure is open filaments. Evidence of a tube defect is often obvious when the filament is open in glass-envelope tubes. You will also notice the brighter-than-normal cherry-red glow of the plate when the plate current is excessive. Also, when the tube becomes gassy or when arcing occurs between electrodes, you will probably have visual indication. Metal-encased tubes can be felt for warmth to determine if the heater is operating. You can tap a tube while it is operating in a circuit to reveal an aural indication of loose elements within the tube or microphonics, which are produced by loose elements.\nMost tubes are extremely fragile and subject to damage during shipment. When you replace a tube, never make the assumption that the new tube is good because it\u2019s new. You should always test tubes before installing them.\nQ-2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What is the most common cause of electron tube failure?\nSubstituting with a tube known to be in good condition is a simple method of testing a questionable tube. However, in high-frequency circuits tube substitution should be carried out in a logical sequence. Replace tubes one at a time so that you can observe the effect of differences in interelectrode capacitance in the substituted tubes on tuned circuits. The tube substitution test method cannot be used to advantage in locating more than one faulty tube in a single circuit for two reasons: (1) If both an rf amplifier tube and IF amplifier tube are defective in a receiver, replacing either one will not correct the trouble; and (2) if all the tubes are replaced, there is no way for you to know what tubes were defective. Under these conditions, using test equipment designed for testing the quality of a tube saves you valuable time.\nQ-3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What is the most accurate method of determining the condition of an electron tube?\n\n\nNOTE ON SYMBOLS USED IN THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS: IEEE and ANSI standards (see inside front cover) are used to define various terms, such as anode (plate) current, anode voltage, and anode resistance. This book uses Ea\u00a0\u00a0 for anode voltage, Ia\u00a0 for anode current, and Ra\u00a0 for anode resistance. These are the same as E, Ip, and Rp\u00a0 that you will see elsewhere. This module uses the terms anode and plate interchangeably.\n\nA representative field type of electron tube tester designed to test all common low-power tubes is shown in figure 2-1. The tube test conditions are as close as possible to actual tube operating conditions and are programmed on a pre-punched card. The card switch (S101, fig. 2-1) automatically programs the tube test conditions when it is actuated by a card. A card compartment on the front panel of the tester provides storage for the most frequently used cards. The cover of the tester (not shown) contains the operating instructions, the brackets for storing the technical manual, the power cord, the calibration cell for checking the meter and short tests, the calibration cards, the blank cards, and a steel hand punch.\n\nElectron tube tester\n\nFigure 2-1.\u2014Electron tube tester.\n\nFront Panel\nWhen a pre-punched card is fully inserted into the card switch (S101), a microswitch is actuated that energizes a solenoid, causing the card switch contacts to complete the circuit. The card switch has 187 single-pole, single-throw switches arranged in 17 rows with 11 switches in each row. The card is used to push the switches closed; thus, the absence of a hole in the card is required to actuate a switch.\n\n\nThe meter (M301) contains four scales. The upper scale is graduated from 0 to 100 for direct numerical readings. The three lower scales, numbered 1, 2, and 3, are read for LEAKAGE, QUALITY, and GAS, respectively. Each numbered scale includes green and red areas marked GOOD and REPLACE. Inside a shield directly in front of the meter are five neon lamps (DS301 through DS305), which indicate shorts between tube elements.\nThe number 2 pushbutton (MP6) is used for transconductance, emission, and other quality tests (described later). The number 3 pushbutton (MP7) is used to test for the presence of gas in the tube envelope. The number 4 pushbutton (MP8) is used for tests on dual tubes. A neon lamp (DS203) lights when pushbutton number 4 is to be used. Eleven tube test sockets are located on the panel, plus tube pin straighteners for the 7- and 9-pin miniature tubes.\nThe power ON-OFF spring-return toggle switch (S105) turns the tester on by energizing a line relay. The pilot light (DS107) lights when this relay closes. Above the power ON-OFF switch are five fuses. Fuses F101, F201, and F202 protect circuits in the tester not protected by other means and have neon lamps to indicate when they have blown. Fuses F102 and F103 protect both sides of the power line.\nAuxiliary Compartment\nA group of auxiliary controls covered by a hinged panel is used for special tests and for calibration of the tester. Two of these controls, labeled SIGNAL CAL (R152 and R155, fig. 2-2), are used with special test cards for adjusting the regulation and amplitude of the signal voltage. A pushbutton labeled CATH ACT (S302D) is used for making cathode activity tests. When this button is pressed, DS106 on the front panel (fig. 2-1) lights, and the filament voltage of the tube under test is reduced by 10%. Results of the test are read as a change in reading on the numerical meter scale.\n\nAuxiliary compartment\n\nFigure 2-2.\u2014Auxiliary compartment.\n\n\n\nPushbutton S302E and potentiometers R401 and R405 (fig. 2-2) are used for balancing the transconductance (Gm) bridge circuit under actual tube operating current. Pressing S302E removes the grid signal and allows a zero balance to be made with one potentiometer or the other, depending upon whether the tube under test is passing high or low plate current. Lamp DS108 on the front panel lights when S302E is pressed. Pushbutton S302C is used for checking grid-to-cathode shorts at a sensitivity much higher than the normal tests. Results of this test are indicated by the short test lamps on the front panel.\nCertain special tests require the use of a continuously adjustable auxiliary power supply. By pressing pushbutton S302B, you may use meter M301 to read the voltage of the auxiliary power supply on meter M301. This voltage may be adjusted by the use of the potentiometer R142. The rest of the potentiometer controls are calibration controls and are adjusted by the use of special calibration cards and a calibration test cell.\nAll circuits in the tester, except the filament supply, are electronically regulated to compensate for line voltage fluctuations. The filament supply voltage is adjusted by pressing pushbutton S302A and rotating the filament standardization adjustment switch S106 until meter M301 reads midscale.\nProgram Cards\nThe circuits to be used in testing are selected by a pre-punched card. These cards are made of tough vinyl plastic material. The tube numbers are printed in color on the tabs of the cards and also at the edge of the card for convenience in filing. A special card is provided to use as a marker when a card is removed for use. Blank cards are provided so that additional test cards may be punched for new tubes that are developed or to replace cards that have become unserviceable.\nBefore operating the tester for the first time, and periodically thereafter, you should calibrate it using the calibration test cards as described in the equipment technical manual.\nNORMAL TESTS.\u2014The tester is equipped with a three-conductor power cord, one wire of which is chassis ground. It should be plugged into a grounded 105- to 125-volt, 50- to 400-hertz outlet.\nBefore operating the tester, open the auxiliary compartment (fig. 2-2) and ensure that the FILAMENT STD ADJ and the Gm BAL knobs are in the NOM position. The GRID SIG and CATH ACT buttons (S302E and S302D) should be up and lamps DS108 and DS106 on the front panel should be out.\nTurn on the tester and allow it to warm up for 5 to 10 minutes, then press the CARD REJECT KNOB (fig. 2-1) down until it locks. If a non-test card is installed in the card switch, remove it. This card is used to keep the switch pins in place during shipment and should be inserted before transporting the tester.\nPlug the tube to be tested into its proper socket. (Use the pin straighteners before plugging in 7- and 9-pin miniature tubes.) Select the proper card or cards for the tube to be tested. Insert the card selected into the slot in the card switch until the CARD REJECT KNOB pops up. The card will operate the tester only if it is fully inserted and the printing is up and toward the operator. Do not put paper or objects other than program cards into the card switch, because they will jam the switch contacts. If the overload shuts off the tester when the card is inserted in the switch, check to see that the proper card is being used for the tube under test and that the tube under test has a direct interelement short.\n\n\nAs soon as the card switch is actuated, the tube under test is automatically subjected to an interelement short test and a heater-to-cathode leakage test. A blinking or steady glow of any of the short test lamps is an indication of an interelement short. If the short test lamps remain dark, no interelement shorts exist within the tube. If a short exists between two or more elements, the short test lamp or lamps connected between these elements remain dark, and the remaining lamps light. The abbreviations for the tube elements are located on the front panel just below the short test shield so that the neon lamps are between them. This enables the operator to tell which elements are shorted. Heater-to-cathode shorts are indicated as leakage currents on the #1 meter scale. If the meter reads above the green area, the tube should be replaced. A direct heater-to-cathode short causes the meter to read full scale.\nTo make the QUALITY test, push the number 2 button (fig. 2-1) and read the number 2 scale on meter M301 to determine if the tube is good. (This test may be one of various types, such as transconductance, emission, plate current, or voltage drop, depending upon the type of tube under test.)\nTo test the tube for GAS, press the number 3 button and read the number 3 meter scale. The number 2 button also goes down when number 3 is pressed. If a dual tube having two identical sections is being tested, the neon lamp (DS203) will light, indicating that both sections of the tube may be tested with one\ncard. To do this, check the tube for shorts, leakage, quality, and gas as described previously; then hold down button number 4 and repeat these tests to test the second section of the tube. Dual tubes with sections that are not identical require two cards for testing. A second card is also provided to make special tests on certain tubes.\nAUXILIARY TEST.\u2014As mentioned previously, two special tests (cathode activity and sensitive grid shorts) may be made by use of controls located in the auxiliary compartment (fig. 2-2). The cathode activity test (CATH ACT) is used to indicate the amount of useful life remaining in the tube. By reducing the filament voltage by 10 percent and allowing the cathode to cool off slightly, the ability of the cathode as an emitter of electrons can be estimated. This test is made in conjunction with the normal quality test.\nTo make the CATH ACT test, allow the tube under test to warm up, press button number 2 (fig. 2-1), and note the reading of scale number 2 on meter M301. Note also the numerical scale reading on M301. Next, lock down the CATH ACT button (fig. 2-2), wait for about 1.5 minutes, then press button number 2 (fig. 2-1) again and note the numerical and number 2 scale readings on meter M301. The tube should be replaced if the numerical reading on M301 differs from the first reading by more than 10 percent or if the reading is in the red area on the number 2 scale.\nIt is sometimes desirable to check certain tubes for shorts at a sensitivity greater than normal. To make the SENSITIVE GRID SHORTS test, push S302C (fig. 2-2) and note if any short test lamps (fig. 2-1) light.\nYou normally test high-power amplifier tubes, which operate in the low-to-high frequency range, in the transmitter in which they are to be used. When you operate the tube in a transmitter, its condition can be determined by using built-in meters to measure the grid current, plate current, and power output and comparing those values with those obtained when using tubes known to be good.\nQ-4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Normally, how are high-power RF tubes tested?\nKlystron Tube Tests\nYou can check low-power klystron tubes for gas, frequency of the output signal, and output power by placing them in the equipment where they are to be used. You measure the beam current, output\n\n\nfrequency, and output power with the transmitter\u2019s built-in test equipment. You can check the output of klystrons used as receiver local oscillators by measuring the current in the crystal mixer unit.\nKlystron tubes that remain inoperative for more than 6 months may become gassy. This condition occurs in klystrons installed in stored or spare equipment as well as in klystrons stored as stock supplies. Operation of a gassy klystron at its rated voltages will ionize the gas molecules and may cause excessive beam current to flow. This excessive beam current may shorten the life of the klystron or produce immediate failure. You can detect gas in a klystron tube by setting the applied reflector voltage to zero and slowly increasing the beam voltage while observing a meter that indicates the beam current - excessive beam current for a specific value of voltage indicates that the tube is gassy.\nA gassy klystron tube can usually be restored to serviceable condition if you temporarily operate it at reduced beam voltage. Eight hours or more of reduced voltage operation may be required for klystrons that have been inoperative for periods in excess of 6 months.\nThe beam current is also an indication of the power output of the klystron. As klystrons age they normally draw less beam current; when this current decreases to a minimum value for a specific beam voltage, the tube must be replaced. You can usually determine the power output of transmitter klystrons by measuring the transmitter power output during equipment performance checks.\nQ-5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What should you do if a klystron becomes gassy?\nTraveling-Wave Tube\nYou can usually test a traveling-wave tube (TWT) in the equipment in which it is used. When the TWT is installed, you can usually measure the collector current and voltage and check the power output for various inputs. Any deviation greater than 10% from normal specifications may be considered to be an indication of a defective tube. Most amplifiers are supplied with built-in panel meters and selector switches so that the cathode, anode, helix, focus, and collector currents may be measured. Thus, continuous monitoring of amplifier operation and tube evaluation is possible. Adjustments usually are provided for you to set the helix, grid bias, and collector voltages for optimum operation. If variation of these controls will not produce normal currents and if all voltages are normal, you should consider the tube to be defective and replace it with a new tube or one known to be in good operating condition. To avoid needless replacement of tubes, however, you should make an additional check by measuring the input power and output power and determining the tube gain. If, with normal operating conditions, the gain level drops below the minimum indicated value in the equipment technical manual, the tube is defective.\nQ-6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When used as an amplifier, what is the best indication that a TWT is operating properly?\nIn the absence of special field-test sets, you may construct a laboratory test mock-up similar to that shown in figure 2-3. Because of the variations in power and gain between tubes and the large frequency ranges offered, we can illustrate only a general type of equipment. The equipment you select must have the proper range, impedance, and attenuation to make the test for a specific type of TWT. To make gain measurements, you turn the switch shown in figure 2-3 to position 1 and set the precision attenuator to provide a convenient level of detector output. Then turn the switch to position 2 and insert attenuation until the detector output level is identical to that obtained without the TWT in the circuit. The gain of the traveling-wave tube is equal to the amount of added attenuation.\n\n\n\nTraveling-wave tube test arrangement\n\nFigure 2-3.\u2014Traveling-wave tube test arrangement.\n\nWhen you use the TWT as an oscillator, failure of the tube to break into oscillations when all other conditions are normal usually indicates a defective tube. In the case of a tube used as a receiving amplifier, an increase of noise with a normal or reduced output can indicate that the tube is failing but is still usable. All the general rules applying to klystron tubes mentioned previously are also applicable to the TWT.\nMagnetron Tube Tests\nYou test a magnetron tube while it is in the transmitter equipment in which it is to be used. When you install the magnetron in the transmitter, the condition of the tube can be determined by the normal plate-current measurement and the power, frequency spectrum, and standing-wave-ratio tests of the output signal. An unusual value for any of these measurements may indicate a defective tube.\nCrossed-Field Amplifier\nYou usually test a crossed-field amplifier (CFA) tube while it is in the equipment in which it is used. Like the klystron, if you do not operate the CFA for more than a few months, the tube may become gassy. If a CFA tube is suspected of being gassy, we recommend that you consult the technical manual for the particular piece of equipment in which the crossed-field amplifier is used.\n\n\nUnlike vacuum tubes, transistors are very rugged in that they can tolerate vibration and a rather large degree of shock. Under normal operating conditions, they will provide dependable operation for a long period of time. However, transistors are subject to failure when they are subjected to relatively minor overloads. Crystal detectors are also subject to failure or deterioration when subjected to electrical overloads and will deteriorate from a long period of normal use. To determine the condition of semiconductors, you can use various test methods. In many cases you may substitute a transistor of known good quality for a questionable one to determine the condition of a suspected transistor. This method is highly accurate and sometimes efficient. However, you should avoid indiscriminate substitution of semiconductors in critical circuits. When transistors are soldered into equipment, substitution becomes impractical - generally, you should test these transistors while they are in their circuits.\nQ-7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What is the major advantage of a transistor over a tube?\n\n\nSince certain fundamental characteristics indicate the condition of semiconductors, test equipment is available that allows you to test these characteristics with the semiconductors in or out of their circuits. Crystal-rectifier testers normally allow you to test only the forward-to-reverse current ratio of the crystal. Transistor testers, however, allow you to measure several characteristics, such as the collector leakage current (Ic), collector to base current gain (b), and the four-terminal network parameters. The most useful test characteristic is determined by the type of circuit in which the transistor will be used. Thus, the alternating-current beta measurement is preferred for ac amplifier or oscillator applications; and for switching-circuit applications, a direct-current beta measurement may prove more useful.\nMany common transistors are extremely heat sensitive. Excess heat will cause the semiconductor to either fail or give intermittent operation. You have probably experienced intermittent equipment problems and know them to be both time consuming and frustrating. You know, for example, that if a problem is in fact caused by heat, simply opening the equipment during the course of troubleshooting may cause the problem to disappear. You can generally isolate the problem to the faulty printed-circuit board (PCB) by observing the fault indications. However, to further isolate the problem to a faulty component, sometimes you must apply a minimal amount of heat to the suspect PCB by carefully using a low wattage, heat shrink gun; an incandescent drop light; or a similar heating device. Be careful not to overheat the PCB. Once the fault indication reappears, you can isolate the faulty component by spraying those components suspected as being bad with a nonconductive circuit coolant, such as Freon. If the alternate heating and cooling of a component causes it to operate intermittently, you should replace it.\nQ-8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Name two major disadvantages of transistors.\nWhen trouble occurs in solid-state equipment, you should first check power supplies and perform voltage measurements, waveform checks, signal substitution, or signal tracing. If you isolate a faulty stage by one of these test methods, then voltage, resistance, and current measurements can be made to locate defective parts. When you make these measurements, the voltmeter impedance must be high enough that it exerts no appreciable effect upon the voltage being measured. Also, current from the ohmmeter you use must not damage the transistors. If the transistors are not soldered into the equipment, you should remove the transistors from the sockets during a resistance test. Transistors should be\nremoved from or reinserted into the sockets only after power has been removed from the stage; otherwise damage by surge currents may result.\nTransistor circuits, other than pulse and power amplifier stages, are usually biased so that the emitter current is from 0.5 milliampere to 3 milliamperes and the collector voltage is from 3 to 15 volts. You can measure the emitter current by opening the emitter connector and inserting a milliammeter in series. When you make this measurement, you should expect some change in bias because of the meter resistance. You can often determine the collector current by measuring the voltage drop across a resistor in the collector circuit and calculating the current. If the transistor itself is suspected, it can be tested by one or more of the methods described below.\nResistance Test\nYou can use an ohmmeter to test transistors by measuring the emitter-collector, base-emitter, and base-collector forward and reverse resistances. A back-to-forward resistance ratio on the order of 100 to 1 or greater should be obtained for the collector-to-base and emitter-to-base measurements. The forward and reverse resistances between the emitter and collector should be nearly equal. You should make all three measurements for each transistor you test, because experience has shown that transistors can develop shorts between the collector and emitter and still have good forward and reverse resistances for the other two measurements. Because of shunting resistances in transistor circuits, you will normally have\n\n\nto disconnect at least two transistor leads from the associated circuit for this test. Exercise caution during this test to make certain that current during the forward resistance tests does not exceed the rating of the transistor \u2014 ohmmeter ranges requiring a current of more than 1 milliampere should not be used for testing transistors. Many ohmmeters are designed such that on the R x 1 range, 100 milliamperes or more can flow through the electronic part under test. For this reason, you should use a digital multimeter. Be sure you select a digital multimeter that produces enough voltage to properly bias the transistor junctions.\nQ-9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When you are using an ohmmeter to test a transistor, what range settings should be avoided?\nTransistor Testers\nLaboratory transistor test sets are used in experimental work to test all characteristics of transistors. For maintenance and repair, however, it is not necessary to check all of the transistor parameters. A check of two or three performance characteristics is usually sufficient to determine whether a transistor needs to be replaced. Two of the most important parameters used for transistor testing are the transistor current gain (beta) and the collector leakage or reverse current (Ic).\nThe semiconductor test set (fig. 2-4) is a rugged, field type of tester designed to test transistors and semiconductor diodes. The set measures the beta of a transistor, resistance appearing at the electrodes, reverse current of a transistor or semiconductor diode, shorted or open conditions of a diode, forward transconductance of a field-effect transistor, and condition of its own batteries.\n\nSemiconductor test set\n\nFigure 2-4.\u2014Semiconductor test set.\n\nIn order to assure that accurate and useful information is gained from the transistor tester, the following preliminary checks of the tester should be made prior to testing any transistors.\nWith the POLARITY switch (fig. 2-4) in the OFF position, the meter pointer should indicate exactly zero. (When required, rotate the meter adjust screw on the front of the meter to fulfill this requirement.) When measurements are not actually being made, the POLARITY switch must always be left in the OFF position to prevent battery drain.\n\n\n\nA Disruptive Web Presence\n\nCustom Search\nOver 10,000 pages indexed!

Smtomak 01:16, 28 June 2007 (UTC)\n\nText references[edit]\n\nThe test refers to entities called A, B and C. Are these waves? Are they the waves in the diagrams? Some clarification would be nice for people who do not know this material.\n\nI think they refer to older diagrams that were replaced without updating the text. \u2014 Omegatron 20:00, 28 November 2005 (UTC)\n\n\nShouldn't the equation be:\n\n\\sin(2 \\pi F t - \\phi)\\, (Note the minus phi rather than the plus)\n\nAs is shown here (albeit with some other variables included).\n\nSurely this way of writing it makes more sense as well as it would mean that a wave that is time shifted in front of another would have a positive phase difference rather than a negative one. It would also make the example make more sense which shows a minus of a phase difference for a wave shifted forward.\n\n--Datr 22:08, 14 February 2006 (UTC)\n\nWhen I first arrived here, people were calling \\phi\\, the phase of the sine function, which contradicts other articles that define frequency as the time-derivative of phase. So I think it is very helpful to be able to refer to \\phi\\, as the initial phase, to clearly distinguish it from the time-variant phase. If you change the sign, it just becomes more awkward. When we tell them that \\phi\\, is the negative of the initial phase, they are bound to wonder why we didn't just use a plus sign. --Bob K 02:46, 15 February 2006 (UTC)\nBy the way, if signal A has an initial phase of 1\u00b0 and signal B has an initial phase of 0\u00b0, then signal A has a head start. In your words, it is \"time-shifted in front of signal B\". But apparently you disagree. So \"in front of\" means different things to different people. --Bob K 03:05, 15 February 2006 (UTC)\nSorry, I'm only doing this at a high school level and so am having problems understanding. Just to be clear are you telling me that \\phi is the negative of the initial phase difference? As unless i'm confusing the math that is the only way the equation using +\\phi would give the correct answer.\nI thought that the initial phase difference would be measured positively (i.e. wave B is \\pi in front of wave A so \\phi = \\pi. But for that to be the case the equation would have to use -\\phi. --Datr 11:49, 17 February 2006 (UTC)\nI've realised I may be overlooking something, I assumed phase difference was measured from the beginning of one wave to the beginning of the next. However, the equation using +\\phi would work if the phase difference was measured from the beginning of the second wave to the end of the first. Is this my mistake? --Datr 12:08, 17 February 2006 (UTC)\nThe initial phase is the phase at t=0. So as it is currently defined, that would be just \\phi\\,. Your definition would make it: -\\phi\\,, or in other words \\phi\\, would be the negative of the initial phase, which is a bit awkward for a definition.\nThe phase-difference between two waveforms is something you define either way (A-B or B-A). It doesn't matter, as long as your interpretation of the results is consistent with your definition. --Bob K 19:39, 18 February 2006 (UTC)\nI'm not sure but I think the problem might be I'm using an incorect defininition. At my school, phi is used to describe how ofset one wave is relative to another (which might be different from the intial phase of a wave). For example a wave that begins pi/4 after another would be said to be pi/4 out of phase relative to the first wave. If you were to use the equation in this article to plot both waves then for it to show the second wave as being pi/4 in front of the first wave you would have to subtract the phase difference. I.e. A-B would have the waves the correct way round but B-A (the intuitive way) would not, do you mean this doesn't matter though and you just refer to the wave in front as the one you know should be in front? Surely this wouldn't work with calculations that depend on the waves points at an exact time though such as working out superposition, would it?\nWould a wave with an intial phase difference of a quarter of a wave have the same initial displacement as the same wave with no intial phase difference but a quarter of the way through an oscillation? Or would a wave with an intial phase difference of a quarter of a wave have the same displacement as a wave with no intial displacement a quarter of an oscillation before? --Datr 21:51, 18 February 2006 (UTC)\nI don't have time to address your questions point-by-point, but I think what you are getting at is that various perspectives are possible, depending on the problem you are trying to model. Indeed, phi can be used \"to describe how offset one wave is relative to another\", as you said. But that presumes the situation you are modelling has two waves. A definition that requires only one wave is also applicable to more complex situations (i.e. two waves). But a definition that requires two waves is useless for just one wave. --Bob K 22:45, 18 February 2006 (UTC)\n\nTake one waveform, copy it and paste it a quarter of an oscillation away. I'm sure you can see that they are not the same. Figure this one out, and you'll also figure why it's + and not -. --Freanz5 03:27, 29 August 2006 (UTC)\n\nI don't agree that it is that simple. For instance, does \"away\" mean to the left or the right?\u00a0 Or what if \\phi\\, is 3\u03c0/2\u00a0? --Bob K 16:36, 29 August 2006 (UTC)\n\nRemoved obsolete material[edit]\n\nI removed the following, which refers to a diagram that no longer exists:\n\nBoth A and B have the same amplitude and the same wavelength.\n\nIt is apparent that the positions of the peaks (X), troughs (Y) and zero-crossing points (Z) of both waves all coincide. The phase difference of the waves is thus zero, or, the waves are said to be in phase.\n\nIf the two in-phase waves A and B are added together (for instance, if they are two light waves shining on the same spot), the result will be a third wave of the same wavelength as A and B, but with twice the amplitude. This is known as constructive interference.\n\n\nA and C are also of the same amplitude and wavelength. However, it can be seen that although the zero-crossing points (Z) are coincident between A and C, the positions of the peaks and troughs are reversed, that is an X on A becomes a Y on C, and vice versa. In this case, the two waves are said to be out of phase or in antiphase, or the phase difference of the two waves is \u03c0 radians, or half the wavelength (\u03bb/2).\n\nIf waves A and C are added, the result is a wave of zero amplitude. This is called destructive interference.\n\nIn this situation, a peak (X) on wave A becomes a zero-crossing point (Z) on D, a zero-point becomes a peak, and so on. The waves A and D can be said to be in quadrature, or exactly \u03c0/2, or \u03bb/4 out of phase.\n\n--Heron 18:21, 18 June 2006 (UTC)\n\nWhy does the diagram no longer exist? \u2014 Omegatron 00:56, 19 June 2006 (UTC)\nBecause its been deleted? 8-)--Light current 01:11, 19 June 2006 (UTC)\nIs it worth reproducing, though? \u2014 Omegatron 19:02, 23 June 2006 (UTC)\nI dont know. I have not seen it 8-|--Light current 19:15, 23 June 2006 (UTC)\n\n\n  \u2022 Agree with all proposed merges. 8-)--Light current 19:45, 23 June 2006 (UTC)\n  \u2022 Ditto. --Bob K 14:21, 24 June 2006 (UTC)\n\nNO! you guys are wrong! \u2014Preceding unsigned comment added by (talk) 02:38, 3 October 2007 (UTC)\n\nMisleading image??[edit]\n\nThe major problem with the image is that the phase difference between the two time-shifted waves should be measured vertically, not horizontally. Horizontal measurement only measures time. Phase difference would be measured as the difference of arccosines of unit-magnitude sinewaves. -swstadel 01 Oct 2010 \u2014Preceding unsigned comment added by (talk) 20:51, 1 October 2010 (UTC)\n\nHuh?? Please explain the difference between time shifting a sine wave and phase shifting a sine wave. \u2014 Omegatron 20:47, 23 June 2006 (UTC)\n\nOnes got a horizontal axis of time, and the other of angle. Normally diagrams like this have the horiz axis as time. So the horiz axis needs labelling in degrees to remove confusion.. That would do it. Also, consider the prime directive: [1] 8-)--Light current 20:55, 23 June 2006 (UTC)\nHow can you justify this image in view of the prime directive? 8-? --Light current 23:46, 23 June 2006 (UTC)\n  \u2022 The what? Please read the rest of that thread. It's mostly about biographies on living people, several others disagreed with Jimbo's sentiments, and he explicitly stated they are not policy. If you want to call it your Prime Directive (which would seem appropriate in light of your deletionist tendencies), you can refer to it as such, but having your own declared modus operandi is not sufficient justification for removing useful information from articles. Vandals have directives, too, but that doesn't make their edits valid.\n  \u2022 Now, please explain the difference between a time-shifted sine wave and a phase-shifted sine wave. Perhaps you could show us some equations? You might want to read the article first, too. \u2014 Omegatron 00:20, 24 June 2006 (UTC)\nI quote from Jimbo's email:\nThis is true of ALL information, but it is particularly true of negative information about living persons.\n\nmy bolding and caps\n\nI have already explained the difference between a time-shifted sine wave and a phase-shifted sine wave diagram. THe diagram is misleading as it stands as it does not have the axes labelled. 8-|\n\n--Light current 00:39, 24 June 2006 (UTC)\n\nI agree that the diagram could/should be better labelled. But it is not wrong, and frankly it is thought-provoking in a good way. It gets your attention. IMO it is better than no diagram. So if you want to delete it, please replace it with a better one.\n--Bob K 05:01, 24 June 2006 (UTC)\nI didnt say it was wrong. I said it was misleading because it is. Misleading info should be removed according to Jimbos directive.> He doesnt say anything about waiting until a new version exists before deleting - does he?--Light current 17:19, 24 June 2006 (UTC)\n  1. It is not misleading.\n  2. Just because an article contains a misleading statement doesn't mean you delete the whole article. You fix it so that it isn't misleading anymore. This should be common sense to a Wikipedian with your experience. If you don't have time or are too lazy to fix it, leave it for someone else to fix. You could even tag it as needing attention so others will notice it needs work. That's why we have a multitude of cleanup and attention tags.\n  3. Misleading information is better than no information? I disagree. Misleading information is better than no information. No information is better than incorrect information, but misleading \u2260 incorrect. While we're at it, incomplete information is better than no information, and correct and complete information is better than all.\n  4. Destroying information is bad. Wasting time with pointless discussions is bad. Especially over trivial things like this. This image has been there for three months with no complaints. If you have a minor complaint like this about something in the article, bring it up on the talk page. Don't go around deleting useful things without discussion. \u2014 Omegatron 17:56, 24 June 2006 (UTC)\nAnd he didn't say anything about judging one element of an article totally out-of-context, which is what you are doing. You haven't said anything about the supporting text, most notably: \u00a0 \"Thus, a shift in time is equivalent to a change in the initial phase. Conversely, a change in the initial phase is tantamount to a shift in time.\" If we delete every figure in Wikipedia that is ambiguous without explanation, that would probably be a majority. Your opinion matters, but it is not the only one that matters. Mine is that in the context of the article, the image is not misleading. And I am asking you to please leave it alone, unless you can make a positive improvement. --Bob K 17:43, 24 June 2006 (UTC)\nI think the diagram needs to be improved forthwith. If I could find out how to do it myself I would. 8-|--Light current 17:47, 24 June 2006 (UTC)\nThank you! Maybe these sources are useful to you:\nI suspect Omegatron would be happy to do it himself, if you can agree on what needs to be done. It's worth a shot.\n--Bob K 18:14, 24 June 2006 (UTC)\nHow would you improve it? \u2014 Omegatron 17:57, 24 June 2006 (UTC)\n\nWell, IMO, all it needs really is the x axis labelling as Phase (deg)-- 0 to 360 say, or Phase (rad) 0 to 2pi.--Light current 18:32, 24 June 2006 (UTC)\n\nIve changed the caption now. Thats all I can do ATM to make it less misleading --Light current 18:46, 24 June 2006 (UTC)\n\nAnd why would an x axis of time be incorrect? \u2014 Omegatron 19:39, 24 June 2006 (UTC)\n\nIt would be incorrect as it stands because the diag shows the distance between the two points shown as being a phase diff. Phase is not the same thing as time 8-|--Light current 20:45, 24 June 2006 (UTC)\n\nSo if the red waveform was \\sin(2 \\pi f t), what would the equation for a phase-shifted version be, and what would the curve look like? \u2014 Omegatron 22:04, 24 June 2006 (UTC)\n\nI assume you are asking these questions in good faith so I will answer likewise. The phase shifted version would of course be a sine wave displaced along the horizontal axis by  phi degrees from the original waveform.\n\nThe equation of the phase shifted waveform is: y=\\sin(2 \\pi f t + phi) NB phi may be +ve or -ve --Light current 22:31, 24 June 2006 (UTC)\n\nExtract from WP:V[edit]\n\n\nIf its not policy, why is it on the policy page?--Light current 00:46, 24 June 2006 (UTC)\n\nAnd this has what to do with the image? \u2014 Omegatron 03:51, 24 June 2006 (UTC)\nNothing. The image is not incorrect. It is not pseudo information. It does not require a source. Could it be even better?... yes. Is it better than nothing?... yes. Is this debate a waste of time?... yes. --Bob K 05:01, 24 June 2006 (UTC)\n\nYou are being obtuse 'O'. REread my above comments. Bob, tHe image is 'misleading'. The directive is to remove misleading info.--Light current 09:51, 24 June 2006 (UTC)\n\nNo. I am expressing a different 'O'pinion than yours. I was not misled by the image, but I did have to stop and think about it. Also note that the image does not stand alone in a vacuum. There is explanatory text, notably this: \u00a0 \"Thus, a shift in time is equivalent to a change in the initial phase. Conversely, a change in the initial phase is tantamount to a shift in time.\" --Bob K 13:08, 24 June 2006 (UTC)\n\nOnly for a fixed frequency!--Light current 20:47, 24 June 2006 (UTC)\n\nWhich is what the whole article is about. I guess you just need to have the last word, so go ahead. Unless it contains some actual substance, I will leave it alone next time. --Bob K 22:33, 24 June 2006 (UTC)\n\nYes thats OK. The diagram(s) though, should reflect what the text is saying. Only when its the correct last word! 8-)--Light current 22:35, 24 June 2006 (UTC)\n\nGood examples of phase difference: [2] The lh phasor diag shows phase diff. The rh waveform shows subsequent time delay between the waveforms.--Light current 23:24, 24 June 2006 (UTC)\n\nVery nice. I suggest we add a link to that site. --Bob K 00:16, 25 June 2006 (UTC)\n\nWhat's with the [single brackets] everywhere? Looks like those should be (parentheses)? \u2014 Omegatron 18:45, 26 June 2006 (UTC)\n\nDoh! You are absolutely right, but I had to check google to find out. It is apparently a bad habit of mine that I have been doing for so long that it looks perfectly normal to me. And this is actually the first time anyone has asked about it. Feel free to fix them, if so inclined. I will try to do better in the future. --Bob K 07:21, 27 June 2006 (UTC)\n\nPhase vs polarity[edit]\n\nIs \"phase shifting a wave by 180\u00b0\" the same thing as \"inverting the polarity of a wave\"? Does it even make sense to say \"phase shifting a wave\" when the wave is not a sinusoid? See Talk:Active_noise_control#Phase_vs._polarity. \u2014 Omegatron 18:31, 10 August 2006 (UTC)\n\nConsider: \u00a0 A(t)\\cdot e^{j [\\omega (t)\\cdot t + \\theta]} = X(t)\\cdot e^{j \\theta} \\,. \u00a0 Unless A(t)\\, and \\omega (t)\\, are constants, this modulated signal is not a sinusoid. Yet a change in \\theta \\, can be construed as a phase shift. Since \u00a0 e^{j (\\theta + \\pi)} = -e^{j \\theta}\\,, \u00a0 a 180\u00b0 shift is equivalent to sign inversion. --Bob K 20:17, 10 August 2006 (UTC)\nWhen someone \"phase shifts a square wave by 180\u00b0\", the outcome is equivalent no matter how you think of it, but if they \"phase shift a square wave by 35\u00b0\", you could think of it as shifting the entire square wave by a fraction of its period, or of shifting each individual frequency component by 35\u00b0, which would make it not a square anymore. Does it make sense to talk about phase shifting arbitrary signals, or only sinusoids?\nAlso, a phase shift in real life implies a time delay, no? So phase shifting an entire signal by 180\u00b0 would require a delay of at least half a period of the lowest frequency present? So a device that instantaneously shifts the phase of every frequency component of a signal by 33\u00b0 is not physically realizable, similar to how non-causal ideal filters aren't physically realizable, and therefore a 180\u00b0 device of the same description would also be impossible, so 180\u00b0 phase shift in real life implies a time delay, and polarity inversion does not?\n  \u2022 \"If you think about it, it's obvious that there is no such thing as \"out-of-phase\" for a sound that has more than one frequency. As the figures above illustrate, any given delay time will yield an infinite number of phase shifts at an equally infinite number of different frequencies. So how can a sound be 180\u00b0 out of phase? Answer: it can't, unless it's a sine wave.\" [3]\n  \u2022 \"Usage Note: polarity vs. phase shift: polarity refers to a signal's reference NOT to its phase shift. Being 180\u00b0 out-of-phase and having inverse polarity are DIFFERENT things. We wrongly say something is out-of-phase when we mean it is inverted. One takes time; the other does not.\" [4]Omegatron 20:53, 10 August 2006 (UTC)\n\nSo going back to my example, are you saying that a sound wave can never have the form:\n\\operatorname{Re}\\left\\{A(t)\\cdot e^{j [\\omega (t)\\cdot t + \\theta]}\\right\\} = A(t)\\cdot \\cos(\\omega (t)\\cdot t + \\theta) \\,\u00a0?\nAlso note that:\nA(t)\\cdot \\cos(\\omega (t)\\cdot t + \\theta +\\pi) + A(t)\\cdot \\cos(\\omega (t)\\cdot t + \\theta) = 0\\,\nwhich represents destructive interference, as occurs when two speakers are wired in opposite phase.\n--Bob K 22:34, 10 August 2006 (UTC)\n\nI took a peek at [5]. I believe the confusion is that his conception of phase shift is limited to the special case of a time-delay that is constant for all frequency components. The corresponding phase shift is a linear function of frequency. So there is only one frequency that can have a 180\u00b0 shift. His perspective makes sense for the case of sound propagation in air, because air is a non-dispersive medium [6]. But his perspective is not the general case of phase-shift possibilities. --Bob K 22:56, 11 August 2006 (UTC)\n\n\nJust moving the template here where it belongs. -- Your friendly, neighborhood housekeeper, Flex 14:41, 6 September 2006 (UTC)\n\nThe first sentence of this article could really bear clarification - maybe even breaking into different sentences. \"fraction of a complete cycle corresponding to an offset in the displacement from a specified reference point..\" - what?? offset, displacement, and reference point are all so closely conceptually related I wonder if they aren't the same thing explained three different ways.. andf how does this fraction correspond to all that whatever? -- (talk) 16:49, 30 June 2008 (UTC)\nMoreover the diagram does apparently nothing (for a novice's eyes anyway) to show where the phase is identified in the waveform. Shouldn't it say \"phase\" somewhere? And is \"period\" in the diagram another way of saying \"cycle\" (in the sentence)? -- (talk) 16:52, 30 June 2008 (UTC)\n\nI concur. I have no idea what the first sentence means. (talk) 04:10, 17 September 2010 (UTC)\n\n\nIt is important to mention that the phase is zero when the wave is maximal. It is mentioned in the definition of \"Instantaneous phase\", but it should be mentioned here too.\n\nPlease sign your comments. First of all, sin(0) = 0, and max( sin ) = 1. Secondly, t=0 is kind of a \"starting point\", and it seems more intuitive (to me) for a wave to start at level 0 and rise to its apex, like a mountain, rather than for the apex to just \"appear\" out of nowhere. So I prefer to keep the sin() function. Third, why would it be \"important\" to mention any of this? It seems rather minor.\n--Bob K 15:15, 27 June 2007 (UTC)\n\nMerge with Antiphase[edit]\n\nYes please MarkAnthonyBoyle 08:48, 27 September 2007 (UTC)\n\nMerge completed, since the little serious replies seen are positive. Fuzzygenius 06:40, 15 October 2007 (UTC)\n\nQuestion worth mentioning[edit]\n\nJust one question: When you spend 1 watt of sending a wave to meet another 1 watt wave in opposite phase, you end up with zero energy because they cancel each other. According to the energy laws; where have those 2 watts in total gone? \u2014Preceding unsigned comment added by (talk) 21:46, 8 October 2008 (UTC)\n\nTo paraphrase a famous quote: \"You can cancel at a point in space for all time, and at a moment in time for all space. But you can't cancel all points at all times.\" (assuming the waves are actually \"meeting\" from opposite directions) Compensating for the point/moment cancellations are other points and moments of constructive interference.\n--Bob K (talk) 01:56, 9 October 2008 (UTC)\nI'm guessing the follow-up question would be... what if they're traveling in the same direction? (e.g., joined at a summing junction somewhere) I assume the answer is that the power that is not transmitted gets eaten at each source. \u2014\u00a0TedPavlic | (talk) 13:18, 9 October 2008 (UTC)\nI assume we would need to get more specific about the nature of the sources and the \"summing junction\". Theoretically, if 2 electrical sources (e.g. batteries) are placed in series and each connected to a resistor, their voltages add. If the sources are equal and opposite, no current flows. No power is expended. Each source effectively sees an infinite resistance, like an open circuit.\n--Bob K (talk) 11:22, 10 October 2008 (UTC)\nConsider the electrical generation of a virtual ground. Two equal and opposite sources with R output impedance are jointed together. The junction between the sources sits steady at 0V, while at each point in time each output impedance dissipates V2/R power. Now remove one of the sources and add an R between the old junction and a true ground (representing power transmission). Now V2/(4R) is dissipated in the source and V2/(4R) is transmitted. If the other source is added again, the transmission will cease, and the total 2 V2/R will be dissipated over the sum of the two output impedances. So, again, the destructive interference that prevents transmission results in constructive interference at the source. That's what I was saying. I think you'll find a similar effect in any type of junction scenario \u2014 reflections will end up generating constructive interference at the source. \u2014TedPavlic | (talk) 14:06, 10 October 2008 (UTC)\nI'm not curious enough to follow that line of reasoning, but it appears to corroborate what I said about \"getting more specific about the nature of the sources and the summing junction.\" Hopefully we have at least answered the original question.\n--Bob K (talk) 15:51, 10 October 2008 (UTC)\n\nInstantaneous phase[edit]\n\n\"Instantaneous phase has a formal definition that is applicable to more general functions and unambiguously defines a function's initial phase at t=0.\" This is definitely wrong, compare with the article about instantaneous phase. Pk72 (talk) 08:54, 7 July 2011 (UTC)\n\n\u03b8 or \u03c6?[edit]\n\nA recent mass change replaced all the \u03b8's with \u03c6's, with the explanation: \"Try to impose a little bit of consistency in notation. Most of the time, the convention is \u03b8 for the entire angle or argument to the sin() function and it's \u03c6 for the phase offset.\"\u00a0 I'm all for consistency, but is that statement a correct one?\u00a0 In my experience, instantaneous phase is always written as \u03c6(t), and the instantaneous phase of \u00a0\\scriptstyle \\cos( 2 \\pi f t + x)\u00a0 is \u00a0\\scriptstyle \\phi(t) = 2 \\pi f t + x.\u00a0 So \u03b8 is a better choice (than \u03c6) for x. \u00a0 --Bob K (talk) 14:13, 16 February 2012 (UTC)\n\nLower case phi \u2013 \u03c6 \u2013 is the correct symbol for phase in terms of practical electronics. As a live sound engineer, I might point out that the Danish letter \u00d8 has often been used to label a switch in polarity. I bring that up because a flip in polarity is often considered by sound guys to be the same as 180\u00b0 of phase shift at all frequencies. Binksternet (talk) 19:33, 16 February 2012 (UTC)\n\nThanks. I assume you are referring to the \"phase offset\" (a constant), rather than \u03c6(t). So perhaps the convention is that when talking about \u03c6(t) (instantaneous phase), phase offsets are represented by \u03b8 to avoid writing \u00a0\\scriptstyle \\phi(t) = 2 \\pi f t + \\phi.\u00a0 And otherwise (such as here), a constant phase offset is most often represented by \u03c6. Another case where that works is the narrowband signal model (Phase_(waves)#In-phase and quadrature (I&Q) components), where the carrier and the phase modulation are considered separately, rather than as a whole instantaneous phase. --Bob K (talk) 20:20, 17 February 2012 (UTC)\n\nPhase term in \"magnitude-phase\" representation of signals[edit]\n\nI am wondering if it may be worth to make a difference of the phase term discussed here with the phase term in the complex domain representation of signals. For example, a sinusoidal signal (real) can be represented in magnitude-phase, and its phase (which in this case can be understood as the angle with respect to the positive real axis) takes only 0 or pi radians. We even can add a \"phase shift\" to the aforementioned signal but the signal phase will still take 0 or pi radians. For example, cos(wt) and cos(wt + phi) can be thought of a real vector in the complex domain varying its magnitude from 1 to -1 periodically. What do you think? \u2014 Preceding unsigned comment added by EthanZur (talkcontribs) 11:42, 3 May 2012 (UTC)\n\nClarification requested on the Phase Compensation section[edit]\n\nThe explanation is vague and it isn't tied in with the figure. What part of this circuit represents phase compensation and what part represents the phase to be compensated? What amplifier stage is switched into the signal path? Is the amplifier in the figure part of a larger system? Constant314 (talk) 00:54, 4 September 2012 (UTC)\n\nUpon further reflection, phase is a subject that transends electronics. I'm not sure that an electronic circuit should even be part of this subject.Constant314 (talk) 13:55, 6 September 2012 (UTC)\n\nPhase compensation, figure is dubious[edit]\n\nThe figure purports to illustrate a phase compensation circuit. But, the circuit has no dc feedback and could not work as a standalone circuit, although it could be an element of a larger system where there was overall dc feedback. But even then it\u2019s not likely to produce useful phase compensation. At low frequency this circuit is an integrator with produces -90\u00b0 degrees of phase shift. As frequency increases (assuming C1 >> C2) the circuit starts to resemble straight gain for frequency greater than \u03c9\u2081 = 1/ (C1 x R2) and less than \u03c9\u2082 = 1/ (C2 x R2). Above \u03c9\u2082 it again resembles an integrator with phase shift of -90\u00b0. So, looking at the phase shift of this circuit, it starts out at -90\u00b0, then it increases toward 0\u00b0, but stays slightly negative and then decreases toward -90\u00b0. This circuit adds negative phase at most frequencies which is usually the opposite of what is needed to stabilize a loop. A lead-lag configuration would be a typical example of phase compensation of a larger loop. Constant314 (talk) 13:44, 6 September 2012 (UTC)\n\nRemoving Phase Compensation[edit]\n\nThe article is about phase which is a very general concept. Phase compensation is a technique used to change the phase shift of an electrical circuit or other linear system. Phase compensation is often used to stabilize circuits and systems that use feedback. A factually correct section about phase compensation might logically appear in an article about feedback, opamps or servos among others. It is out of place in this article.\n\nThe figure has no explanation of how the circuit works, what it does or how to use it. The particular circuit depicted is unlikely to be used for phase compensation because its phase shift is always negative.\n\nPhase compensation is not a correction for phase error. It can be used to adjust the phase shift of a circuit.\n\nPhase compensation is not required to obtain stability in an opamp but it can be used to improve the phase margin of an opamp and it can be used to stabilize a circuit that includes an opamp.\n\nPhase compensation does not subtract out an amount of phase shift from a signal which is equal to the amount of phase shift added by switching one or more additional amplifier stages into the amplification signal path.

Well anyhow, I vote \"no\", because this article is about a constant, and the other article is about a time-variant function.\n\n--Bob K (talk) 17:57, 18 October 2013 (UTC)\n\nI vote no also. Constant314 (talk) 00:30, 19 October 2013 (UTC)\n\nI vote no. Article instantaneous phase is about concepts related to but distinct from the topic of article phase (waves). (What's more, the \"encyclopedic voices\" adopted by the two articles are different. Merging would probably mean cacophony.) --\u03bd\u03b7\u03bc\u03b9\u03bd\u03c5\u03bb\u03b9 (talk) 04:05, 5 March 2014 (UTC)\n\nNo. for all of the above reasons. But the Instantaneous phase article needs improvement. (talk) 03:50, 23 May 2014 (UTC)\n\nMerge with phase angle[edit]\n\nI vote no, since phase angle can be applied to any complex number or 2D vector, while the phase of this article is only applicable to waves.

Ulflund (talk) 21:25, 23 April 2014 (UTC)\n\nI vote no because the two topics are distinctly different and the articles are also quite different in tone, approach and content. \u2014\u00a0Preceding unsigned comment added by (talk) 15:51, 16 May 2014 (UTC) (UTC) I agree. The article \"phase angle\" is about a mathematical object, while the article \"phase (waves)\" is about a physical phenomenon. The two topics are not sufficiently closely related to warrant merging. They should be linked to each other, but remain separate articles. 15:59, 16 May 2014 (UTC) (UTC) I agree with the above. The articles are distinct and serve separate purposes.

According to this theory matter was made from small indivisible particles called atoms.\nBut after several experiments many particles have been discovered with in the atom which are electrons, protons, neutrons, positrons etc. For the discovery of these fundamental particles the experiments are as follows.\n1. Faraday\u2019s experiment indicates the existence of electron.\n2. Crook\u2019s tube experiment explains the discovery of electron and proton.\n3. Radioactivity also confirms the presence of electrons and protons.\n4. Chadwick\u2019s experiment shows the presence of neutrons.\nThe details of these experiments are given below.\nFaraday\u2019s Experiment\nPassage of Electricity Through Solution\nIn this experiment Faraday passed the electricity through an electrolytic solution. He observed that when two metal plates called electrodes are placed in an electrolytic solution and electricity is passed through his solution the ions present in the solution are moves towards their respective electrodes. In other words these ions are moves towards the oppositely charge electrodes to give up their charge and liberated as a neutral particles.\nFaraday also determined the charges of different ions and the amount of elements liberated from the electrolytic solution. Due to this experiment presence of charge particles in the structure of atoms is discovered. The basic unit of electric charge was later named as electron by Stoney in 1891.\nDiagram Coming Soon\nCrook\u2019s Tube Or Discharge Tube Experiment\nPassage of Electricity Through Gases Under Low Pressure\nThe first of the subatomic particles to be discovered was electron. The knowledge about the electron was derived as a result of the study of the electric discharge in the discharge tube by J.J. Thomson in 1896. This work was later extended by W. Crooke\nWorking of Discharge Tube\nWhen a very high voltage about 10,000 volts is applied between the two electrodes, no electric discharge occurs until the part of the air has been pumped out of the tube. When the pressure of the gas inside the tube is less than 1 mm, a dark space appears near the cathode and thread like lines are observed in the rest of 0.01 mm Hg it fills the whole tube. The electric discharge passes between the electrodes and the residual gas in the tube begins to glow. These rays which proceed from the cathode and move away from it at right angle in straight lines are called cathode rays.\nProperties of Cathode Rays\n1. They travel in straight lines away from the cathode and produce shadow of the object placed in their path.\n2. The rays carry a negative charge.\n3. These rays can also be easily deflected by an electrostatic field.\n4. The rays can exert mechanical pressure showing that these consist of material particle which are moving with kinetic energy.\n5. The produce fluorescence when they strike the glass wall of the discharge tube.\n6. Cathode rays produce x-rays when they strike a metallic plate.\n7. These rays consists of material particle whose e/m resembles with electron.\n8. These rays emerge normally from the cathode and can be focused by using a concave cathode.\nPositive Rays\nIn 1890 Goldstein used a discharge tube with a hole in the cathode. He observed that while cathode rays were emitting away from the cathode, there were coloured rays produced simultaneously which passed through the perforated cathode and caused a glow on the wall opposite to the anode. Thomson studied these rays and showed that they consisted of particles carrying a positive charge. He called them positive rays.\nProperties of Positive Rays\n1. These rays travel in a straight line in a direction opposite to the cathode.\n2. These are deflected by electric as well as magnetic field in the way indicating that they are positively charged.\n3. The charge to mass ratio (e/m) of positive particles varies with the nature of the gas placed in the discharge tube.\n4. Positive rays are produced from the ionization of gas and not from anode electrode.\n5. Positive rays are deflected in electric field. This deflection shows that these are positively charged so these are named as protons.\nThe Information Obtained From Discharge Tube Experiment\nThe negatively charge particles electrons and the positively charge particles protons are the fundamental particle of every atom.\nIn 1895, Henry Becqueral observed that uranium and its compounds spontaneously emitted certain type of radiation which affected a photographic plate in the dark and were able to penetrate solid matter. He called these rays as radioactivity rays and a substance which possessed the property of emitting these radioactivity rays was said to be radioactivity element and the phenomenon was called radioactivity.\nOn further investigation by Maric Curic, it was found that the radiation emitted from the element uranium as well as its salts is independent of temperature and the source of the mineral but depend upon the mineral but depend upon the quantity of uranium present e.g. Pitchblende U3O8 was found to be about four times more radioactive than uranium.\nRadioactive Rays\nSoon after the discovery of radium it was suspected that the rays given out by radium and other radioactive substance were not of one kind. Rutherford in 1902 devised an ingenious method for separating these rays from each other by passing them between two oppositely charged plate. It was observed that the radioactive rays were of three kinds, the one bending towards the negative plate obviously carrying positive charge were called \u03b1-rays and those deflected to the positive plate and carrying -ve charge were named as \u03b2-rays. The third type gamma rays, pass unaffected and carry no charge.\nProperties of \u03b1 \u2013 RAYS\n1. These rays consists of positively charged particles.\n2. These particles are fast moving helium nuclei.\n3. The velocity of \u03b1-particles is approximately equal to 1/10th of the velocity of light.\n4. Being relatively large in size, the penetrating power of \u03b1-rays is very low.\n5. They ionize air and their ionization power is high.\nProperties of \u03b2 \u2013 RAYS\n1. These rays consists of negatively charged particles.\n2. These particles are fast moving electron.\n3. The velocity of \u03b2-particles is approximately equal to the velocity of light.\n4. The penetrating power of \u03b2-rays is much greater than \u03b1-rays.\n5. These rays ionizes gases to lesser extent.\nProperties of \u03b3 \u2013 RAYS\n1. Gamma rays do not consist of particles. These are electromagnetic radiations.\n2. They carry no charge so they are not deflected by electric or magnetic field.\n3. Their speed is equal to that of light.\n4. These are weak ionizer of gases.\n5. Due to high speed and non-material nature they have great power of penetration.\nChadwick Experiment (Discovery of Neutron)\nWhen a light element is bombarded by \u03b1-particles, these \u03b1-particles leaves the nucleus in an unstable disturbed state which on settling down to stable condition sends out radioactivity rays. The phenomenon is known as \u201cArtificial Radioactivity\u201d.\nIn 1933, Chadwick identified a new particle obtained from the bombardment of beryllium by \u03b1-particles. It had a unit mass and carried no charge. It was named \u201cNeutron\u201d.\nSpectroscopic Experiment\nAfter the discovery of fundamental particles which are electrons, protons & neutron, the next question concerned with electronic structure of atom.\nThe electronic structure of the atom was explained by the spectroscopic studies. In this connection Plank\u2019s Quantum theory has great impact on the development of the theory of structure of atom.\nPlanck\u2019s Quantum Theory\nIn 1900, Max Planck studied the spectral lines obtained from hot body radiations at different temperatures. According to him,\nWhen atoms or molecules absorb or emit radiant energy, they do so in separate units of waves called Quanta or Photons.\nThus light radiations obtained from excited atoms consists of a stream of photons and not continuous waves.\nThe energy E of a quantum or photon is given by the relation\nE = h v\nWhere v is the frequency of the emitted radiation and h the Planck\u2019s constant. The value of h = 6.62 x 10(-27) erg. sec.\nThe main point of this theory is that the amount of energy gained or lost is quantized which means that energy change occurs in small packets or multiple of those packets, hv, 2 hv, 3 hv and so on.\nA spectrum is an energy of waves or particles spread out according to the increasing or decreasing of some property. E.g. when a beam of light is allowed to pass through a prism it splits into seven colours. This phenomenon is called dispersion and the band of colours is called spectrum. This spectrum is also known as emission spectrum. Emission spectra are of two types.\n1. Continuous Spectrum\n2. Line Spectrum\n1. Continuous Spectrum\nWhen a beam of white light is passed through a prism, different wave lengths are refracted through different angles. When received on a screen these form a continuous series of colours bands: violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow and red (VIBGYOR). The colours of this spectrum are so mixed up that there is no line of demarcation between different colours. This series of bands that form a continuous rainbow of colours is called continuous spectrum.\nDiagram Coming Soon\n2. Line Spectrum\nWhen light emitted from a gas source passes through a prism a different kind of spectrum may be obtained.\nIf the emitted from the discharge tube is allowed to pass through a prism some discrete sharp lines on a completely dark back ground are obtained. Such spectrum is known as line spectrum. In this spectrum each line corresponds to a definite wave length.\nDiagram Coming Soon\nIdentification of Element By Spectrum\nEach element produces a characteristics set of lines, so line spectra came to serve as \u201cfinger prints\u201d for the identification of element. It is possible because same element always emit the same wave length of radiation. Under normal condition only certain wave lengths are emitted by an element.\nRutherford\u2019s Atomic Model\nEvidence for Nucleus and Arrangement of Particles\nHaving known that atom contain electrons and a positive ion, Rutherford and Marsden performed their historic \u201cAlpha particle scattering experiment\u201d in 1909 to know how and where these fundamental particles were located in the structure of atom.\nRutherford took a thin of gold with thickness 0.0004 cm and bombarded in with \u03b1-particles. He observed that most of the \u03b1-particles passed straight through the gold foil and thus produced a flash on the screen behind it. This indicated that old atoms had a structure with plenty of empty space but some flashes were also seen on portion of the screen. This showed that gold atoms deflected or scattered \u03b1-particles through large angles so much so that some of these bounced back to the source.\nBased on these observations Rutherford proposed a model of the atom which is known as Rutherford\u2019s atomic model.\nDiagram Coming Soon\nAssumption Drawn From the Model\n1. Atom has a tiny dense central core or the nucleus which contains practically the entire mass of the atom leaving the rest of the atom almost empty.\n2. The entire positive charge of the atom is located on the nucleus. While electrons were distributed in vacant space around it.\n3. The electrons were moving in orbits or closed circular paths around the nucleus like planets around the sun.\n4. The greater part of the atomic volume comprises of empty space in which electrons revolve and spin.\nWeakness of Rutherford Atomic Model\nAccording to the classical electromagnetic theory if a charged particle accelerate around an oppositely charge particle it will radiate energy. If an electron radiates energy, its speed will decrease and it will go into spiral motion finally falling into the nucleus. Similarly if an electron moving through orbitals of ever decreasing radii would give rise to radiations of all possible frequencies. In other words it would given rise to a continuous spectrum. In actual practise, atom gives discontinuous spectrum.\nX-Rays and Atomic Number\nIn 1895, W.Roentgen discovered that when high energy electrons from cathode collide with the anode in the Crook\u2019s tube, very penetrating rays are produced. These rays were named as X-rays.\nWhen an electron coming from the cathode strike with the anode in the crook\u2019s tube, it can remove an electron from the inner shell of the atom. Due to removal of t his electron the electronic configuration of this ion is unstable and an electron from an orbital of higher energy drops into the inner orbital by emitting energy in form of a photon. This photon corresponds to electromagnetic radiations in the x-rays region.\nRelationship Between Wave Length and Nuclear Charge\nIn 1911, Mosley stablished a relationship between the wave length and nuclear charge. He found that when cathode rays struck elements used as anode targets in the discharge tube, characteristic x-rays were emitted. The wave length of the x-rays emitted decreases regularly with the increase of atomic mass. On careful examination of his data Mosely found that the number of positive charges on the nucleus increases from atom to atom by single electronic unit. He called the number of positive charges as the atomic number.\nDiagram Coming Soon\nBohr\u2019s Theory\nRutherford\u2019s model of atom fails to explain the stability of atom and appearance of the line spectra. Bohr in 1913 was the first to present a simple model of the atom which explained the appearance of line spectra.\nSome of the postulates of Bohr\u2019s theory are given below.\n1. An atom has a number of stable orbits or stationary states in which an electron can reside without emission or absorption of energy.\n2. An electron may pass from one of these non-radiating states to another of lower energy with the emission of radiations whose energy equals the energy difference between the initial and final states.\n3. In any of these states the electrons move in a circular path about the nucleus.\n4. The motion of the electron in these states is governed by the ordinary laws of mechanics and electrostatic provided its angular momentum is an integral multiple of h/2\u03c0\nIt can be written as\nmvr = nh / 2\u03c0\nHere mvr becomes the angular momentum of the electron. Thus Bohr\u2019s first condition defining the stationary states could be stated as\n\u201cOnly those orbits were possible in which the angular momentum of the electrons would be an integral multiple of h/2\u03c0\u201d. These stationary states correspond to energy levels in the atom.\nCalculation of Radius of Orbits\nConsider an electrons of charge e revolving.\nAtomic number and e the charge on a proton.\nLet m be the mass of the electro, r the radius of the orbit and v the tangential velocity of the revolving electron.\nThe electrostatic force of attraction between the nucleus and the electron according to Coulomb\u2019s law\n= Z e x e / r2\nDiagram Coming Soon\nThe centrifugal force acting on the electron.\n= mv2 / r\nBohr assumed that these two opposing forces must be balanced each other exactly to keep the electron in an orbit.\nZe2 / r2 = m v2 / r\nMultiply both sides by r\nr x Ze2 / r2 = r x m v2 / r\nZe2 / r = m v2\nr = Ze2 / m v2 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 (1)\nThe Bohr\u2019s postulate states that only those orbits are possible in which\nmvr = nh / 2\u03c0\nV = nh / 2\u03c0mr\nSubstituting the value of V in eq (1)\nr = Ze2 / m(nh/2\u03c0mr)2\nr = Ze2 x 4\u03c02 mr2/n2h2\n1/r = 4\u03c02mZe2/n2h2\nr = n2h2 / 4\u03c02mZe2 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 (2)\nThis equation gives the radii of all the possible stationary states. The values of constants present in this equation are as follows.\nH = 6.625 x 10(-27) ergs sec OR 6.625 x 10(-37) J.s\nMe = 9.11 x 10(-28) gm OR 9.11 x 10(-31) kg\nE = 4.802 x 10(-10) e.s.u OR 1.601 x 10(-19) C\nBy substituting these values we get for first shell of H atom\nr = 0.529 x 10(-8) m OR 0.529\nThe above equation may also be written as\nr = n2 (h2 / 4\u03c02mZe2) x n2 a0 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. (3)\nFor the first orbit n = 1 and r = 0.529. This is the value of the terms in the brackets sometimes written as a0 called Bohr\u2019s Radius. For the second shell n = 2 and for 3rd orbit n = 3 and so on.\nHydrogen Atom Spectrum\nBalmer Series\nThe simplest element is hydrogen which contain only one electron in its valence shell.\nBalmer in 1885 studied the spectrum of hydrogen. For this purpose he used hydrogen gas in the discharge tube. Balmer observed that hydrogen atom spectrum consisted of a series of lines called Balmer Series. Balmer determined the wave number of each of the lines in the series and found that the series could be derived by a simple formula.\nLyman Series\nLyman series is obtained when the electron returns to the ground state i.e. n = 1 from higher energy level n(2) = 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. This series of lines belongs to the ultraviolet region of spectrum.\nPaschen Series\nPaschen series is obtained when the electron returns to the 3rd shell i.e. n = 3 from the higher energy levels n2 = 4, 5, 6 etc. This series belongs to infrared region.\nBracket Series\nThis series is obtained when an electron jumps from higher energy levels to 4th energy level.\nHeisenberg Uncertainty Principle\nAccording to Bohr\u2019s theory an electron was considered to be a particle but electron also behaves as a wave according to be Broglie.\nDue to this dual nature of electron in 1925 Heisenberg gave a principle known as Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle which is stated as,\nIt is impossible to calculate the position and momentum of a moving electron simultaneously.\nIt means that if one was known exactly it would be impossible to known the other exactly. Therefore if the uncertainty in the determination of momentum is \u0394px and the uncertainty in position is \u0394x then according to this principle the product of these two uncertainties may written as\n\u0394px . \u0394x \u2248 h\nSo if one of these uncertainties is known exactly then the uncertainty in its determination is zero and the other uncertainty will become infinite which is according to the principle.\nEnergy Levels and Sub-Levels\nAccording to Bohr\u2019s atomic theory, electrons are revolving around the nucleus in circular orbits which are present at definite distance from the nucleus. These orbits are associated with definite energy of the electron increasing outwards from the nucleus, so these orbits are referred as Energy Levels or Shells.\nThese shells or energy levels are designated as 1, 2, 3, 4 etc K, L, M, N etc.\nThe spectral lines which correspond to the transition of an electron from one energy level to another consists of several separate close lying lines as doublets, triplets and so on. It indicates that some of the electrons of the given energy level have different energies or the electrons belonging to same energy level may differ in their energy. So the energy levels are accordingly divided into sub energy levels which are denoted by letters s, p, f (sharp, principle, diffuse & fundamental).\nThe number of sub levels in a given energy level or shell is equal to its value of n.\ne.g. in third shell where n = 3 three sub levels s, p, d are possible.\nQuantum Numbers\nThere are four quantum numbers which describe the electron in an atom.\n1. Principle Quantum Number\nIt is represented by \u201cn\u201d which describe the size of orbital or energy level.\nThe energy level K, L, M, N, O etc correspond to n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 etc.\nn = 1 the electron is in K shell\nn = 2 the electron is in L shell\nn = 3 the electron is in M shell\n2. Azimuthal Quantum Number\nThis quantum number is represented by \u201cl\u201d which describes the shape of the orbit. The value of Azimuthal Quantum number may be calculated by a relation.\nl = 0 \u2014-> n \u2013 1\nSo for different shell the value of l are as\nn = 1 K Shell l = 0\nn = 2 L Shell l = 0, 1\nn = 3 M Shell l = 0, 1, 2\nn = 4 N Shell l = 0, 1, 2, 3\nwhen l = 0 the orbit is s\nwhen l = 1 the orbit is p\nwhen l = 2 the orbit is d\nwhen l = 3 the orbit is f\n3. Magnetic Quantum Number\nIt is represented by \u201cm\u201d and explains the magnetic properties of an electron. The value of m depends upon the value of l. It is given by\nm = + l \u2014-> 0 \u2014-> l\nwhen l = 1, m has three values (+1, 0, -1) which corresponds to p orbital. Similarly when l = 2, m has five values which corresponds to d orbital.\n4. Spin Quantum Number\nIt is represented by \u201cs\u201d which represents spin of a moving electron. This spin may be either clockwise or anticlockwise so the values for s may be +1/2 or -1/2.\nPauli\u2019s Exclusion Principle\nAccording to this principle\nNo two electrons in the same atom can have the same four quantum number.\nConsider an electron is present in 1s orbital. For this electron n = 1, l = 0, m = 0. Suppose the spin of this electron is s = +1/2 which will be indicated by an upward arrow \u2191. Now if another electron is put in the same orbital (1s) for that electron n = 1, l = 0, m = 0. It can occupy this orbital only if the direction of its spin is opposite to that of the first electron so s = -1/2 which is symbolized by downward arrow \u2193. From this example, we can observe the application of Pauli\u2019s exclusion principle on the electronic structure of atom.\nElectronic Configuration\nThe distribution of electrons in the available orbitals is proceeded according to these rules.\n1. Pauli Exclusion Principle\n2. Aufbau Principle\n3. (n + l) Rule\n4. Hund\u2019s Rule\nThe detail of these rules and principles is given below.\n1. Aufbau Principle\nIt is states as\nThe orbitals are filled up with electrons in the increasing order of their energy.\nIt means that the orbitals are fulled with the electrons according to their energy level. The orbitals of minimum energy are filled up first and after it the orbitals of higher energy are filled.\n2. Hund\u2019s Rule\nIf orbitals of equal energy are provided to electron then electron will go to different orbitals and having their parallel spin.\nIn other words we can say that electrons are distributed among the orbitals of a sub shell in such a way as to give the maximum number of unpaired electrons and have the same direction of spin.\n3. (n + l) Rule\nAccording to this rule\nThe orbital with the lowest value of (n + l) fills first but when the two orbitals have the same value of (n + l) the orbital with the lower value of n fills first.\nFor the electronic configuration the order of the orbital is as follows.\n1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s, 4d, 5p, 6s etc.\nAtomic Radius\nFor homonuclear diatomic molecules the atomic radius may be defined as\nThe half of the distance between the two nuclei present in a homonuclear diatomic molecules is called atomic radius.\nIt may be shown as\nIn case of hetronuclear molecular like AB, the bond length is calculated which is (rA + rB) and if radii of any one is known the other can be calculated.\nFor the elements present in periodic table the atomic radius decreases from left to right due to the more attraction on the valence shell but it increases down the group with the increase of number of shells.\nIonic Radius\nIonic radius is defined as\nThe distance between nucleus of an ion and the point up to which nucleus has influence of its electron cloud.\nWhen an electron is removed from a neutral atom the atom is left with an excess of positive charge called a cation e.g\nNa \u2014-> Na+ + c-\nBut when an electron is added in a neutral atom a negative ion or anion is formed.\nCl + e- \u2014-> Cl-\nAs the atomic radius, the ionic radii are known from x-ray analysis. The value of ionic radius depends upon the ions that surround it.\nIonic radii of cations have smaller radii than the neutral atom because when an electron is removed. The effective charge on the nucleus increases and pulls the remaining electrons with a greater force.\nIonic radii of anions have a large radii than the neutral atom because an excess of negative charge results in greater electron repulsion.\nRadius of Na atom = 1.57\nRadius of Na+ atom = 0.95 (smaller than neutral atom)\nRadius of Cl atom = 0.99\nRadius of Cl- atom = 1.81 (larger than neutral atom)\nIonization Potential\nThe amount of energy required to remove most loosely bounded electron from the outermost shell of an atom in its gaseous state is called is called ionization potential energy.\n\nIt is represented as\nM(gas) \u2014-> M+(gas) + e- \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. \u0394E = I.P\nThe energy required to remove first electron is called first I.P. The energy required to remove 2nd or 3rd electron is called 2nd I.P or 3rd I.P\nM+(gas) \u2014-> M++(gas) + e- \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u0394E = 2nd I.P\nM++(gas) \u2014-> M+++(gas) + e- \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 \u0394E = 3rd I.P\nThe units of I.P is kilo-Joule per mole.\nFactors on which I.P Depends\n1. Size of the Atom\nIf the size of an atom is bigger the I.P of the atom is low, but if the size of the atom is small then the I.P will be high, due to fact if we move down the group in the periodic table. The I.P value decreases down the group.\n2. Magnitude of Nuclear Charge\nIf the nuclear charge of atom is greater than the force of attraction on the valence electron is also greater so the I.P value for the atom is high therefore as we move from left to right in the periodic table the I.P is increased.\n3. Screening Effect\nThe shell present between the nucleus and valence electrons also decreases the force of attraction due to which I.P will be low for such elements.\nElectron Affinity\nThe amount of energy liberated by an atom when an electron is added in it is called electron affinity.\nIt shows that this process is an exothermic change which is represented as\nCl + e- \u2014-> Cl- \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 \u0394H = -348 kJ / mole\nFactors on which Electron Affinity Depends\n1. Size of the Atom\nIf the size of atom is small, the force of attraction from the nucleus on the valence electron will be high and hence the E.A for the element will also be high but if the size of the atoms is larger the E.A for these atoms will be low.\n2. Magnitude of the Nuclear Charge\nDue to greater nuclear charge the force of attraction on the added electron is greater so the E.A of the atom is also high.\n3. Electronic Configuration\nThe atoms with the stable configuration has no tendency to gain an electron so the E.A of such elements is zero. The stable configuration may exist in the following cases.\n1. Inert gas configuration\n2. Fully filled orbital\n3. Half filled orbital\n\nThe force of attraction by which an atom attract a shared pair of electrons is called electronegativity.\nApplication of Electronegativity\n1. Nature of Chemical Bond\nIf the difference of electronegativity between the two combining atoms is more than 1.7 eV, the nature of the bond between these atoms is ionic but if the difference of electronegativity is less than 1.7 eV then the bond will be covalent.\n2. Metallic Character\nIf an element possesses high electronegativity value then this element is a non-metal but if an element exist with less electronegativity, it will be a metal.\nFactors for Electronegativity\n1. Size of the Atom\nIf the size of the atom is greater the electronegativity of the atom is low due to the large distance between the nucleus and valence electron.\n2. Number of Valence Electrons\nIf the electrons present in the valence shell are greater in number, the electronegativity of the element is hig\n\n\n  1. Thi\u0455 information is \u0456nvaluable.

Therefore, you can depend on it.\n\nPython 3.6 (CPython)\n\nAs of Python 3.6, for the CPython implementation of Python, dictionaries maintain insertion order by default.

As of today (2019), in 3.7+ you must turn this feature on using a future statement (from __future__ import annotations). In Python 3.6 or below, use a string.\n\nI guess you got this exception:\n\nNameError: name \"Position\" is not defined\n\nThis is because Position must be defined before you can use it in an annotation unless you are using Python 3.10 or later.\n\nPython 3.7+: from __future__ import annotations\n\nPython 3.7 introduces PEP 563: postponed evaluation of annotations. A module that uses the future statement from __future__ import annotations will store annotations as strings automatically:\n\nfrom __future__ import annotations\n\nclass Position:\n    def __add__(self, other: Position) -> Position:\n\nThis is scheduled to become the default in Python 3.10. Since Python still is a dynamically typed language so no type checking is done at runtime, typing annotations should have no performance impact, right? Wrong! Before python 3.7 the typing module used to be one of the slowest python modules in core so if you import typing you will see up to 7 times increase in performance when you upgrade to 3.7.\n\nPython <3.7: use a string\n\nAccording to PEP 484, you should use a string instead of the class itself:\n\nclass Position:\n    def __add__(self, other: \"Position\") -> \"Position\":\n\nIf you use the Django framework this may be familiar as Django models also use strings for forward references (foreign key definitions where the foreign model is self or is not declared yet). This should work with Pycharm and other tools.\n\n\nThe relevant parts of PEP 484 and PEP 563, to spare you the trip:\n\nForward references\n\nWhen a type hint contains names that have not been defined yet, that definition may be expressed as a string literal, to be resolved later.\n\nA situation where this occurs commonly is the definition of a container class, where the class being defined occurs in the signature of some of the methods. For example, the following code (the start of a simple binary tree implementation) does not work:\n\nclass Tree:\n    def __init__(self, left: Tree, right: Tree):\n        self.left = left\n        self.right = right\n\nTo address this, we write:\n\nclass Tree:\n    def __init__(self, left: \"Tree\", right: \"Tree\"):\n        self.left = left\n        self.right = right\n\nThe string literal should contain a valid Python expression (i.e., compile(lit, \"\", \"eval\") should be a valid code object) and it should evaluate without errors once the module has been fully loaded. The local and global namespace in which it is evaluated should be the same namespaces in which default arguments to the same function would be evaluated.\n\nand PEP 563:\n\n\nIn Python 3.10, function and variable annotations will no longer be evaluated at definition time. Instead, a string form will be preserved in the respective\u00ac\u2020__annotations__\u00ac\u2020dictionary. Static type checkers will see no difference in behavior, whereas tools using annotations at runtime will have to perform postponed evaluation.\n\n\nEnabling the future behavior in Python 3.7\n\nThe functionality described above can be enabled starting from Python 3.7 using the following special import:\n\nfrom __future__ import annotations\n\nThings that you may be tempted to do instead\n\nA. Define a dummy Position\n\nBefore the class definition, place a dummy definition:\n\nclass Position(object):\n\nclass Position(object):\n\nThis will get rid of the NameError and may even look OK:\n\n>>> Position.__add__.__annotations__\n{\"other\": __main__.Position, \"return\": __main__.Position}\n\nBut is it?\n\n>>> for k, v in Position.__add__.__annotations__.items():\n...     print(k, \"is Position:\", v is Position)                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \nreturn is Position: False\nother is Position: False\n\nB. Monkey-patch in order to add the annotations:\n\nYou may want to try some Python meta programming magic and write a decorator to monkey-patch the class definition in order to add annotations:\n\nclass Position:\n    def __add__(self, other):\n        return self.__class__(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)\n\nThe decorator should be responsible for the equivalent of this:\n\nPosition.__add__.__annotations__[\"return\"] = Position\nPosition.__add__.__annotations__[\"other\"] = Position\n\nAt least it seems right:\n\nreturn is Position: True\nother is Position: True\n\nProbably too much trouble.\n\nAnswer #4\n\nAs you are in python3 , use dict.items() instead of dict.iteritems()\n\niteritems() was removed in python3, so you can\"t use this method anymore.\n\nTake a look at Python 3.0 Wiki Built-in Changes section, where it is stated:\n\nRemoved dict.iteritems(), dict.iterkeys(), and dict.itervalues().\n\nInstead: use dict.items(), dict.keys(), and dict.values() respectively.\n\nAnswer #5\n\nMy quick & dirty JSON dump that eats dates and everything:\n\njson.dumps(my_dictionary, indent=4, sort_keys=True, default=str)\n\ndefault is a function applied to objects that aren\"t serializable.\nIn this case it\"s str, so it just converts everything it doesn\"t know to strings. Which is great for serialization but not so great when deserializing (hence the \"quick & dirty\") as anything might have been string-ified without warning, e.g. a function or numpy array.\n\nAnswer #6\n\na = numpy.array([0, 3, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 4])\nunique, counts = numpy.unique(a, return_counts=True)\ndict(zip(unique, counts))\n\n# {0: 7, 1: 4, 2: 1, 3: 2, 4: 1}\n\nNon-numpy way:\n\nUse collections.Counter;\n\nimport collections, numpy\n\n# Counter({0: 7, 1: 4, 3: 2, 2: 1, 4: 1})\n\nAnswer #7\n\nBecause [] and {} are literal syntax. Python can create bytecode just to create the list or dictionary objects:\n\n>>> import dis\n>>> dis.dis(compile(\"[]\", \"\", \"eval\"))\n  1           0 BUILD_LIST               0\n              3 RETURN_VALUE        \n>>> dis.dis(compile(\"{}\", \"\", \"eval\"))\n  1           0 BUILD_MAP                0\n              3 RETURN_VALUE        \n\nlist() and dict() are separate objects. Their names need to be resolved, the stack has to be involved to push the arguments, the frame has to be stored to retrieve later, and a call has to be made. That all takes more time.\n\nFor the empty case, that means you have at the very least a LOAD_NAME (which has to search through the global namespace as well as the builtins module) followed by a CALL_FUNCTION, which has to preserve the current frame:\n\n>>> dis.dis(compile(\"list()\", \"\", \"eval\"))\n  1           0 LOAD_NAME                0 (list)\n              3 CALL_FUNCTION            0\n              6 RETURN_VALUE        \n>>> dis.dis(compile(\"dict()\", \"\", \"eval\"))\n  1           0 LOAD_NAME                0 (dict)\n              3 CALL_FUNCTION            0\n              6 RETURN_VALUE        \n\nYou can time the name lookup separately with timeit:\n\n>>> import timeit\n>>> timeit.timeit(\"list\", number=10**7)\n>>> timeit.timeit(\"dict\", number=10**7)\n\nThe time discrepancy there is probably a dictionary hash collision. Subtract those times from the times for calling those objects, and compare the result against the times for using literals:\n\n>>> timeit.timeit(\"[]\", number=10**7)\n>>> timeit.timeit(\"{}\", number=10**7)\n>>> timeit.timeit(\"list()\", number=10**7)\n>>> timeit.timeit(\"dict()\", number=10**7)\n\nSo having to call the object takes an additional 1.00 - 0.31 - 0.30 == 0.39 seconds per 10 million calls.\n\nYou can avoid the global lookup cost by aliasing the global names as locals (using a timeit setup, everything you bind to a name is a local):\n\n>>> timeit.timeit(\"_list\", \"_list = list\", number=10**7)\n>>> timeit.timeit(\"_dict\", \"_dict = dict\", number=10**7)\n>>> timeit.timeit(\"_list()\", \"_list = list\", number=10**7)\n>>> timeit.timeit(\"_dict()\", \"_dict = dict\", number=10**7)\n\nbut you never can overcome that CALL_FUNCTION cost.\n\nAnswer #8\n\nThere are many ways to convert an instance to a dictionary, with varying degrees of corner case handling and closeness to the desired result.\n\n1. instance.__dict__\n\n\nwhich returns\n\n{\"_foreign_key_cache\": <OtherModel: OtherModel object>,\n \"_state\": <django.db.models.base.ModelState at 0x7ff0993f6908>,\n \"auto_now_add\": datetime.datetime(2018, 12, 20, 21, 34, 29, 494827, tzinfo=<UTC>),\n \"foreign_key_id\": 2,\n \"id\": 1,\n \"normal_value\": 1,\n \"readonly_value\": 2}\n\nThis is by far the simplest, but is missing many_to_many, foreign_key is misnamed, and it has two unwanted extra things in it.\n\n2. model_to_dict\n\nfrom django.forms.models import model_to_dict\n\nwhich returns\n\n{\"foreign_key\": 2,\n \"id\": 1,\n \"many_to_many\": [<OtherModel: OtherModel object>],\n \"normal_value\": 1}\n\nThis is the only one with many_to_many, but is missing the uneditable fields.\n\n3. model_to_dict(..., fields=...)\n\nfrom django.forms.models import model_to_dict\nmodel_to_dict(instance, fields=[ for field in instance._meta.fields])\n\nwhich returns\n\n{\"foreign_key\": 2, \"id\": 1, \"normal_value\": 1}\n\nThis is strictly worse than the standard model_to_dict invocation.\n\n4. query_set.values()\n\n\nwhich returns\n\n \"foreign_key_id\": 2,\n \"id\": 1,\n \"normal_value\": 1,\n \"readonly_value\": 2}\n\nThis is the same output as instance.__dict__ but without the extra fields. foreign_key_id is still wrong and many_to_many is still missing.\n\n5. Custom Function\n\nThe code for django\"s model_to_dict had most of the answer. It explicitly removed non-editable fields, so removing that check and getting the ids of foreign keys for many to many fields results in the following code which behaves as desired:\n\nfrom itertools import chain\n\ndef to_dict(instance):\n    opts = instance._meta\n    data = {}\n    for f in chain(opts.concrete_fields, opts.private_fields):\n        data[] = f.value_from_object(instance)\n    for f in opts.many_to_many:\n        data[] = [ for i in f.value_from_object(instance)]\n    return data\n\nWhile this is the most complicated option, calling to_dict(instance) gives us exactly the desired result:\n\n \"foreign_key\": 2,\n \"id\": 1,\n \"many_to_many\": [2],\n \"normal_value\": 1,\n \"readonly_value\": 2}\n\n6. Use Serializers\n\nDjango Rest Framework\"s ModelSerialzer allows you to build a serializer automatically from a model.\n\nfrom rest_framework import serializers\nclass SomeModelSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):\n    class Meta:\n        model = SomeModel\n        fields = \"__all__\"\n\n\n\n{\"auto_now_add\": \"2018-12-20T21:34:29.494827Z\",\n \"foreign_key\": 2,\n \"id\": 1,\n \"many_to_many\": [2],\n \"normal_value\": 1,\n \"readonly_value\": 2}\n\nThis is almost as good as the custom function, but auto_now_add is a string instead of a datetime object.\n\nBonus Round: better model printing\n\nIf you want a django model that has a better python command-line display, have your models child-class the following:\n\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom itertools import chain\n\nclass PrintableModel(models.Model):\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return str(self.to_dict())\n\n    def to_dict(instance):\n        opts = instance._meta\n        data = {}\n        for f in chain(opts.concrete_fields, opts.private_fields):\n            data[] = f.value_from_object(instance)\n        for f in opts.many_to_many:\n        return data\n\n    class Meta:\n        abstract = True\n\nSo, for example, if we define our models as such:\n\nclass OtherModel(PrintableModel): pass\n\nclass SomeModel(PrintableModel):\n    normal_value = models.IntegerField()\n    readonly_value = models.IntegerField(editable=False)\n    auto_now_add = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)\n    foreign_key = models.ForeignKey(OtherModel, related_name=\"ref1\")\n    many_to_many = models.ManyToManyField(OtherModel, related_name=\"ref2\")\n\nCalling SomeModel.objects.first() now gives output like this:\n\n \"foreign_key\": 2,\n \"id\": 1,\n \"many_to_many\": [2],\n \"normal_value\": 1,\n \"readonly_value\": 2}\n\nAnswer #9\n\nAre dictionaries ordered in Python 3.6+?\n\nThey are insertion ordered[1]. As of Python 3.6, for the CPython implementation of Python, dictionaries remember the order of items inserted. This is considered an implementation detail in Python 3.6; you need to use OrderedDict if you want insertion ordering that\"s guaranteed across other implementations of Python (and other ordered behavior[1]).\n\nAs of Python 3.7, this is no longer an implementation detail and instead becomes a language feature. From a python-dev message by GvR:\n\nMake it so. \"Dict keeps insertion order\" is the ruling. Thanks!\n\nThis simply means that you can depend on it. Other implementations of Python must also offer an insertion ordered dictionary if they wish to be a conforming implementation of Python 3.7.\n\nHow does the Python 3.6 dictionary implementation perform better[2] than the older one while preserving element order?\n\nEssentially, by keeping two arrays.\n\n  \u2022 The first array, dk_entries, holds the entries (of type PyDictKeyEntry) for the dictionary in the order that they were inserted. Preserving order is achieved by this being an append only array where new items are always inserted at the end (insertion order).\n\n  \u2022 The second, dk_indices, holds the indices for the dk_entries array (that is, values that indicate the position of the corresponding entry in dk_entries). This array acts as the hash table. When a key is hashed it leads to one of the indices stored in dk_indices and the corresponding entry is fetched by indexing dk_entries. Since only indices are kept, the type of this array depends on the overall size of the dictionary (ranging from type int8_t(1 byte) to int32_t/int64_t (4/8 bytes) on 32/64 bit builds)\n\nIn the previous implementation, a sparse array of type PyDictKeyEntry and size dk_size had to be allocated; unfortunately, it also resulted in a lot of empty space since that array was not allowed to be more than 2/3 * dk_size full for performance reasons. (and the empty space still had PyDictKeyEntry size!).\n\nThis is not the case now since only the required entries are stored (those that have been inserted) and a sparse array of type intX_t (X depending on dict size) 2/3 * dk_sizes full is kept. The empty space changed from type PyDictKeyEntry to intX_t.\n\nSo, obviously, creating a sparse array of type PyDictKeyEntry is much more memory demanding than a sparse array for storing ints.\n\nYou can see the full conversation on Python-Dev regarding this feature if interested, it is a good read.\n\nIn the original proposal made by Raymond Hettinger, a visualization of the data structures used can be seen which captures the gist of the idea.\n\nFor example, the dictionary:\n\nd = {\"timmy\": \"red\", \"barry\": \"green\", \"guido\": \"blue\"}\n\nis currently stored as [keyhash, key, value]:\n\nentries = [[\"--\", \"--\", \"--\"],\n           [-8522787127447073495, \"barry\", \"green\"],\n           [-9092791511155847987, \"timmy\", \"red\"],\n           [-6480567542315338377, \"guido\", \"blue\"]]\n\nInstead, the data should be organized as follows:\n\nindices =  [None, 1, None, None, None, 0, None, 2]\nentries =  [[-9092791511155847987, \"timmy\", \"red\"],\n\nAs you can visually now see, in the original proposal, a lot of space is essentially empty to reduce collisions and make look-ups faster. With the new approach, you reduce the memory required by moving the sparseness where it\"s really required, in the indices.\n\n[1]: I say \"insertion ordered\" and not \"ordered\" since, with the existence of OrderedDict, \"ordered\" suggests further behavior that the `dict` object *doesn\"t provide*. OrderedDicts are reversible, provide order sensitive methods and, mainly, provide an order-sensive equality tests (`==`, `!=`). `dict`s currently don\"t offer any of those behaviors/methods.\n[2]: The new dictionary implementations performs better **memory wise** by being designed more compactly; that\"s the main benefit here. Speed wise, the difference isn\"t so drastic, there\"s places where the new dict might introduce slight regressions ([key-lookups, for example][10]) while in others (iteration and resizing come to mind) a performance boost should be present. Overall, the performance of the dictionary, especially in real-life situations, improves due to the compactness introduced.\n\nAnswer #10\n\njson.dumps() converts a dictionary to str object, not a json(dict) object! So you have to load your str into a dict to use it by using json.loads() method\n\nSee json.dumps() as a save method and json.loads() as a retrieve method.\n\nThis is the code sample which might help you understand it more:\n\nimport json\n\nr = {\"is_claimed\": \"True\", \"rating\": 3.5}\nr = json.dumps(r)\nloaded_r = json.loads(r)\nloaded_r[\"rating\"] #Output 3.5\ntype(r) #Output str\ntype(loaded_r) #Output dict\n\nGet Solution for free from DataCamp guru",
    "output": "\n\nAnswer #11\n\nThe Python 3.6 documentation states that dictionaries retain insertion order.\n\nIn the Python 3.7 release notes, it is mentioned that dictionaries will always retain insertion order.\n\nIf you are using a version of Python that does not guarantee that dictionaries retain insertion order, then you should use an OrderedDict from the collections module, which guarantees that order will be retained. This is also a drop-in replacement in Python 3.6 and 3.7.\n\nAnswer #12\n\nHere is an example of a recursive defaultdict:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nclass Subdefaultdict(defaultdict):\n    def __init__(self, type, *args, **kwargs):\n        super().__init__(lambda: Subdefaultdict(type), *args, **kwargs)\n        self.type = type\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return repr({k: v for k, v in self.items()})\n\n\ndef recursive_defaultdict_factory(nesting_level, type):\n    if nesting_level == 1:\n        return Subdefaultdict(type)\n        return Subdefaultdict(lambda: recursive_defaultdict_factory(nesting_level - 1, type))\n\ndef recursive_defaultdict(nesting_level, type):\n    \"\"\"Return a defaultdict that can be nested up to nesting_level deep\"\"\"\n    return recursive_defaultdict_factory(nesting_level, type)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(recursive_defaultdict(0, int))\n    print(recursive_defaultdict(1, int))\n    print(recursive_defaultdict(2, int))\n    print(recursive_defaultdict(3, int))\n    print(recursive_defaultdict(4, int))\n\nWhich outputs:\n\ndefaultdict(<function recursive_defaultdict.<locals>.<lambda> at 0x7f499b9b2510>, {})\ndefaultdict(<class 'int'>, {})\ndefaultdict(<class '__main__.Subdefaultdict'>, {})\ndefaultdict(<class '__main__.Subdefaultdict'>, {1: defaultdict(<class '__main__.Subdefaultdict'>, {})})\ndefaultdict(<class '__main__.Subdefaultdict'>, {1: defaultdict(<class '__main__.Subdefaultdict'>, {2: defaultdict(<class '__main__.Subdefaultdict'>, {})})})\ndefaultdict(<class '__main__.Subdefaultdict'>, {1: defaultdict(<class '__main__.Subdefaultdict'>, {2: defaultdict(<class '__main__.Subdefaultdict'>, {3: defaultdict(<class '__main__.Subdefaultdict'>,"
