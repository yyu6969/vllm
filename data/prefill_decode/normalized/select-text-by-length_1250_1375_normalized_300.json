    "What is a transfer of electrons?\n\n1 Answer\nDec 28, 2015\n\n\nTransfer of electron in chemistry is the process by which an atom \"hands over\" one or more of their electron\n\n\nAccording to current theories dating mainly the 19-20th centuries, the world is made up of atoms.\n\nAtoms in general are unstable when in single form, except noble gases, e.g. Helium.\n\nIn order to \"solve\" their instability issue, atoms combine.\n\nThere are mainly two types of Bonds, the name given for these combinations: Ionic and Covalent bond (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covalent_bond).\n\nIn the former, we have a distortion of the orbital towards the strongest one, \"negativity\", whereas in the latter we have a \"equal\" sharing.\n\nIn the ionic bond we say the electron was transferred, notwithstanding it does not really happen.\n\nWhat happens is that the electron(s) will stay closer to one nucleus, e.g. H-Cl (Hydrogen chloride, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_chloride), in the case mentioned, the electronegativity, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronegativity, of Cl is much higher, thus the hydrogen \"loses\" its only electron, if it loses at all, it will be just a proton, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen\n\nIonic bonds is in general for metals, whereas coval",

I also attached an article, which discusses different theories of stress. I also attached a sample article written in APA format and another APA resource for future reference.\n\n\n1. Define the concept of stress?\n\nOne way to define stress is \"a state of bodily or mental tension resulting from factors that tend to alter an existent equilibrium\" (Britannica Concise Encyclopedia, n.d .). However, many theories of stress have been proposed (see attached article), which define the concept of stress based on their theory.\n\nFor example, Hans Selye (1985) defined stress as \"\"nonspecific\" in that the stress response can result from a variety of different kinds of stressors and he thus focused on the internal aspects of stress\" (cited in Cordon, 1997). In fact, Selye (1956) developed a three stage stress model including:\n\n(a) Alarm reaction is an initial stage of lowered resistance ...\n\nSolution Summary\n\nDefines the concept of stress and explains the physiology and psychology of stress.

    "Michelson-Morley experiment\n\nAim of the Michelson-Morley experiment: The Michelson-Morley experiment was done to confirm the presence of hypothetical medium called ether.\n\nTherefore, one question should be there what was ether? Yes, I have used \u201cwas ether\u201d not \u201cis ether\u201d. Let us discuss why?\n\nAs we have already discussed in earlier articles that there is nothing like absolute rest. Thus the scientists in the 19th century assumed that our universe is filled with hypothetical medium called ether. Ether was supposed to be transparent and highly elastic.\n\nThe main objective of this Michelson-Morley experiment was to check the presence of this medium called ether. The aim was supposed to be fulfilled by measuring the velocity of the earth with respect to the ether. If earth is supposed to be propagating through the stationary ether with a uniform velocity and if a beam of light is sent from source to observer towards the direction of the motion of the earth, then it should take more time if sent through the opposite direction. If this time difference can be measured then velocity of earth with respect to ether can be measured.\n\nExperimental arrangement of Michelson-Morley experiment: Continue reading \u201cMichelson-Morley experiment\u201d\n\nShare and Like article, please:<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>",

What is this other place and how it is accessible?\n\nIt is to be reached by those who, born with the nature of the lover, are also authentically philosophic by inherent temper; in pain of love towards beauty but not held by material loveliness, taking refuge from that in things whose beauty is of the soul- such things as virtue, knowledge, institutions, law and custom- and thence, rising still a step, reach to the source of this loveliness of the Soul, thence to whatever be above that again, until the uttermost is reached. The First, the Principle whose beauty is self-springing: this attained, there is an end to the pain inassuageable before.\n\n\nThe guiding thought is this: that the beauty perceived on material things is borrowed.\n\n\nNow, what is this that gives grace to the corporeal?\n\n\nWe ask then is soul, of itself, a thing of beauty: we find it is not since differences are manifest, one Soul wise and lovely, another foolish and ugly: soul-beauty is constituted by wisdom.\n\nThe question thus becomes, \"What principle is the giver of wisdom to the soul? and the only answer is \"The Intellectual-Principle,\" the veritably intellectual, wise without intermission and therefore beautiful of itself.\n\nBut does even this suffice for our First?\n\n\nNext: Section 3<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>",
    "Bark damage to eastern redbud\n\n\n\nI have an Eastern Redbud, the wind broke off 2 large branches, is there anything I can put on the tree to protect it from the elements as the bark is torn away.\n\n\n\n\nThe bark of a tree is the external vascular system that carries water and nutrients vital to a tree\u2019s survival. Therefore any damage to a tree\u2019s bark can have potentially fatal consequences. What is the extent of the bark damage? If the area of torn bark is more than 25% of the cirucumfrance of the branch or trunk, then you may need to consult an arborist.\n\nIf the bark damage is relatively small, then you can probably clean up the wound yourself. The key is to faciliate the tree to callous around the wound properly. Therefore, do not put any products onto the wound. With a sharp knife, carefully remove all the loose bark to the point where bark is sound and firmly attached. Make sure the knife has been disinfected (you can dip it in rubbing alcohol or household bleach and dry it thoroughly before cutting). Do not remove more bark than absolutely necessary, and do not to cut into the inner bark. Then leave it to the tree to do the rest.\n\nFor further information on tree bark damage, take a look at:\n\nIdentifying Damage\n\nTo find a certified arborist, start here:\n\n\n\nGood luck!<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>"
