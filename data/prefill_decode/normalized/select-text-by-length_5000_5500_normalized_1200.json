We will focus on those that have a concrete impact on the expected Process or Effect (in practical design). The absolute basis for the analysis of the flame is the famous one: \u201cBurnt Triangle\u201d, already sufficient for fat, mourning, and: \u201cQuadrilateral of Combustion\u201d, (preceded by this \u201cTriangle\u201d), necessary for flame burning.\n\nCorrect combustion triangle according to a thorough analysis of the combustion of Stanis\u0142aw Ranger Combustion Quadrangle\n\nOf course, the above scheme is indicated mainly for:\n\n  1. Total combustion, which occurs when a whole mass of the burned substance is oxidized.\n    It occurs when not only does there be no smoke or combustible substances in the ash, but also part of the fuel in the form of steam does not escape. Total combustion occurs as a result of the reaction of oxygen to the substance, when the amount of oxygen is not less than the resulting stoichiometry.\n  2. Complete combustion, the product of which is the most durable of the possible chemical compound in a given reaction, e.g. C + O2 CO2, whether combustion will be complete or incomplete is determined by the over-air factor.\n  3. and the excess air ratio.\n\nThis applies to these ideal, \u201ccosmic\u201d conditions for such combustion, but, but \u2013 let\u2019s go down to our, \u201cEarth\u201d, because this is where these \u201cstairs\u201d begin.\n\nA\u2019propos of these stairs (and the Cosmos..!).

    "SEER Training Modules\n\nTypes of Radiation Therapy\n\nThere are two main types of radiation therapy: external beam radiation (teletherapy) and internal radiation therapy (brachytherapy).\n\nExternal Beam Radiation Therapy (Teletherapy)\n\nExternal beam radiation therapy is radiation delivered from a distant source, from outside the body and directed at the patient's cancer site. Systems which produce different types of radiation for external beam therapy include orthovoltage x-ray machines, Cobalt-60 machines, linear accelerators, proton beam machines, and neutron beam machines. A radiation oncologist makes decisions regarding the type of system that is best suited to treat a specific cancer patient. External beam therapy is the radiation therapy treatment option used for most cancer patients. It is used to treat many types of tumors including cancers of the head and neck area, breast, lung, colon, and prostate.\n\nDepending upon tumor location, different levels of radiation are used for external beam therapy. Low-energy radiation does not penetrate very deeply into the body and is used mainly to treat surface tumors such as skin cancer. High-energy radiation is used to treat other deeper cancers.\n\nStereotactic radiation therapy involves focusing the radiation beam on a small area and delivering very high doses. The therapy targets a tumor from many different directions so the beams of radiation converge on the tumor. This way, the ideal amount of radiation needed to destroy tumor cells is delivered directly to the tumor growth, while the amount of exposure to the area surrounding the tumor is minimized. Stereotactic radiation therapy is very effective in treating small tumors such as those in the head and brain.\n\nExternal beam therapy is painless. Most patients do not need to stay in the hospital while they are having external beam therapy. Patients do not see or feel the actual treatment. Many patients can go home following each treatment, and most patients can even continue with their normal daily activities. Sources of external beam radiation may include, but are not limited to: X-ray, cobalt, linear accelerator, neutron beam, betatron, spray radiation, stereotactic radiosurgery such as gamma knife, and proton beam.\n\nGamma Knife\n\nDeveloped in 1968 by Swedish professors Lars Leksell and Borge Larsson, the gamma knife (sometimes called the \"Leksell-Larsson Gamma Knife\") is a highly advanced instrument used to treat arteriovenous malformations (AVM), facial pain, benign and malignant brain tumors, and other functional brain disorders. What makes the gamma knife so unique is that it successfully treats these conditions with no incision. Instead, it uses a concentrated radiation dose from Cobalt-60 sources. A total of 201 beams of radiation intersect to form a powerful tool focused on a targeted area of abnormal tissue within the brain. Amazingly, the gamma knife is so precise that it damages and destroys the unhealthy tissue while sparing adjacent normal, healthy tissue.\n\nInternal Radiation Therapy (Brachytherapy)\n\nBrachytherapy involves placing radiation sources as close as possible to the tumor site. Sometimes, they may be inserted directly into the tumor. The radioactive sources or isotopes are in the form of wires, seeds (or molds), or rods. This technique is particularly effective in treating cancers of the cervix, uterus, vagina, rectum, eye, and certain head and neck cancers. It is also occasionally used to treat cancers of the breast, brain, skin, anus, esophagus, lung, bladder, and prostate.\n\nIn some instances, brachytherapy may be used in conjunction with external beam therapy. When both forms are employed, the external beam radiation is intended to destroy cancerous cells in a large area surrounding the tumor, while the brachytherapy delivers a boost, or higher dose of radiation, to help destroy the main concentrated mass of tumor cells.\n\nThere are several types of brachytherapy characterized by different methods of placing radiation inside the body: interstitial brachytherapy, intracavitary brachytherapy, intraluminal radiation therapy, and radioactively tagged molecules given intravenously.\n\nInterstitial brachytherapy involves implanting radioactive needles or wires in the tumor area. The radioactive sources may be put in and taken out on the same day; removed from the body after several days; or may stay in the patient permanently.\n\nWith intracavitary brachytherapy, a radiation oncologist places radioactive sources, using a metal or plastic device (applicator), in body cavities such as the vagina, uterus, or larynx to irradiate the walls of the cavity or nearby tissues. Usually the radioactive source is afterloaded into the applicator. When the specified dose of radiation has been delivered to the tumor, the physician removes the applicator containing the radioactive isotope.\n\nIntraluminal radiation therapy delivers radiation to hollow organs. For example, a surgeon or a radiation oncologist inserts a specially designed tube or applicator into the lumen, or opening, of the esophagus to treat cancer.\n\nFinally, radioactive particles can be attached to small molecules and given intravenously. For example, I-131 is used intravenously to treat bony metastases.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>",

    "\n\nSign up\nHere's how it works:\n  1. Anybody can ask a question\n  2. Anybody can answer\n\nThe Point-In-Polygon problem is fairly well documented on this forum. My question is if there is a way to use Google's free tools, i.e. Google Maps, Fusion Tables, and possibly Google Refine, to solve this problem.\n\nI am ultimately attempting to create a heat map of neighborhood boundaries. In basic language here are the steps that I wish to perform: 1. Geocode a list of home addresses using Fusion Table's built-in feature. This yields a set of lat/long coordinates for each address. 2. Import a Shapefile of polygons into Google Fusion to store the boundaries (polygon coordinates). *I am able to get this far.. The next steps are where I am looking for some guidance. 3. Apply a point-in-polygon algorithm to identify which addresses fall within each boundary. What is the simplest way to do this considering that I am ultimately attempting to color-code each polygon depending on the number of points that lie within its boundary lines.\n\n\nshare|improve this question\nup vote 3 down vote accepted\n\nUnfortunately none of the google api's support this query beyond simple rectangles or circles.\n\nYour options are to pre-process using QGIS or the OGR API. Or you can implement the ray casting algorithm in JavaScript.\n\nAlso - check out the source of this example:\n\nIf you implement the algorithm yourself I'm not sure if you can use the loaded shapefile polygons as you would need access the coordinates but there are other ways around that issue.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nAs mentioned, javascript based ray-casting is a good choice. Here is a script from tparkin :\n\nIt extends the google maps api v3 polygon class with a new method called containsLatLng which accepts a single LatLng object, which represents the point that you are actually checking against the polygon.\n\nTo import a shapefile into Fusion Tables, use which is really easy to use. After you are done importing, you can see that the polygons, stored in your shapefile are now in your Fusion Tables table in KML format.\n\nHere comes the tricky part. Use Google Visualization query in Javascript, and with that query choose the polygons that you want to inspect. By this query, the KML formatted text will also be in the result set. Put that in a variable and put that variable between two string: <Placemark> </Placemark> (You can find some tutorials on the web about how to make google polygons from KML using Javascript) And finally, if you managed to transform that KML into a google maps api polygon object, you will be good to go with the ray casting algorithm.\n\nIf there is anything you don't understand or need help with, just shoot me a message here!\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nThe Google maps API does not already provide a method for checking points in polygons. After researching a bit I stumbled across the Ray-casting algorithm which will determine if an X-Y coordinate is inside a plotted shape. This will translate to latitude and longitude. The following extends the google.maps.polygon.prototype to use this algorithm. Simply include this code at a point in the code after google.maps has loaded:\n\ngoogle.maps.Polygon.prototype.Contains = function(point) { var crossings = 0, path = this.getPath();\n\n// for each edge\nfor (var i=0; i < path.getLength(); i++) {\n    var a = path.getAt(i),\n        j = i + 1;\n    if (j >= path.getLength()) {\n        j = 0;\n    var b = path.getAt(j);\n    if (rayCrossesSegment(point, a, b)) {\n\n// odd number of crossings?\nreturn (crossings % 2 == 1);\n\nfunction rayCrossesSegment(point, a, b) {\n    var px = point.lng(),\n        py =,\n        ax = a.lng(),\n        ay =,\n        bx = b.lng(),\n        by =;\n    if (ay > by) {\n        ax = b.lng();\n        ay =;\n        bx = a.lng();\n        by =;\n    // alter longitude to cater for 180 degree crossings\n    if (px < 0) { px += 360 };\n    if (ax < 0) { ax += 360 };\n    if (bx < 0) { bx += 360 };\n\n    if (py == ay || py == by) py += 0.00000001;\n    if ((py > by || py < ay) || (px > Math.max(ax, bx))) return false;\n    if (px < Math.min(ax, bx)) return true;\n\n    var red = (ax != bx) ? ((by - ay) / (bx - ax)) : Infinity;\n    var blue = (ax != px) ? ((py - ay) / (px - ax)) : Infinity;\n    return (blue >= red);\n\n\n}; Here we have extended the functionality of google.maps.Polygon by defining a function with name \u2018Contains\u2019 which can be used to determine whether the latitude longitude provided in function parameter are within the polygon or not. Here we make use of Ray-casting algorithm and developed a function using the same. After doing this much of exercise now, we can check a point as follows:\n\nvar point = new google.maps.LatLng(52.05249047600099, -0.6097412109375); var polygon = new google.maps.Polygon({path:[INSERT_PATH_ARRAY_HERE]}); if (polygon.Contains(point)) { // point is inside polygon }\n\nFor complete code and demo please go to:\n\nshare|improve this answer\nI have exactly the same issue",

Marks sometimes uses the paradox of the smallest \u201cuninteresting\u201d number to illustrate proof by contradiction \u2014 that is, by creating paradoxes\n\nIn this week\u2019s podcast, \u201cThe Chaitin Interview IV: Knowability and Unknowability,\u201d Walter Bradley Center director Robert J. Marks interviewed mathematician Gregory Chaitin on how he proved that the number that determines whether computer programs are elegant (in the sense of maximally efficient) is \u201cunknowable.\u201d As Dr. Chaitin explained in the segment published yesterday, any solution would be contradictory. Thus, his proof is a proof by contradiction.\n\nBy way of illustrating the concept of proof by contradiction, Dr. Marks then offered his proof by contradiction that \u201call positive integers \u2014 numbers like 6 or 129, or 10 100 \u2014 are interesting.\u201d\n\nThis portion begins at 19:45 min. A partial transcript, Show Notes, and Additional Resources follow.\n\nRobert J. Marks: If [some positive integers] are not interesting, there is a smallest, non-interesting number. But hey, that\u2019s interesting!\n\nGregory Chaitin: Absolutely.\n\nRobert J. Marks: That\u2019s the proof by contradiction.\n\nGregory Chaitin (pictured): An uninteresting number would be one whose numerical value is irreducible. And that\u2019s exactly the proof\u2026 That\u2019s a very good explanation, because then the next step from that to my incompleteness theorem is to say, \u201cWell, what does \u2018interesting\u2019 mean?\u201d\n\nAnd one good definition of \u201cinteresting\u201d is: An interesting number is one that stands out because there is a more concise definition of it or, more precisely, a program that is substantially smaller than its numerical value that calculates it\u2026 that\u2019s some way it stands out from the run-of-the-mill numbers. And the run-of-the-mill numbers are ones whose numerical value is an incompressible or irreducible string of bits. So you can sort of go step by step from that paradox about the smallest uninteresting number, which is, ipso facto, interesting, to a proof very similar to mine.\n\nNote: \u201cOne of the most powerful types of proof in mathematics is proof by contradiction or an indirect proof. It is powerful because it can be used to prove any statement, in several fields of mathematics. The structure is simple: assume the statement to be proven is false, and work to show its falsity until the result of that assumption is a contradiction.\u201d \u2013 \u201cProof by Contradiction (with Examples),\u201d Tutors.com.\n\nFor example, Dr. Marks starts with the assumption that some positive integers are not interesting. He looks for evidence that the statement is false. He sees that there must be a smallest non-interesting positive integer. But even that integer is interesting by virtue of its smallness.\n\nNext: Why human creativity is probably non-computable\n\nDon\u2019t miss the stories and links from the previous podcasts:\n\nFrom Podcast 4:\n\nWhy the unknowable number exists but is uncomputable. Sensing that a computer program is \u201celegant\u201d requires discernment. Proving mathematically that it is elegant is, Chaitin shows, impossible. Gregory Chaitin walks readers through his proof of unknowability, which is based on the Law of Non-Contradiction.\n\nGetting to know the unknowable number (more or less). Only an infinite mind could calculate each bit. Gregory Chaitin\u2019s unknowable number, the \u201chalting probability omega,\u201d shows why, in general, we can\u2019t prove that programs are \u201celegant.\u201d\n\nFrom Podcast 3:\n\nA question every scientist dreads: Has science passed the peak? Gregory Chaitin worries about the growth of bureaucracy in science: You have to learn from your failures. If you don\u2019t fail, it means you\u2019re not innovating enough. Robert J. Marks and Gregory Chaitin discuss the reasons high tech companies are leaving Silicon Valley for Texas and elsewhere.\n\nGregory Chaitin on how bureaucracy chokes science today. He complains, They\u2019re managing to make it impossible for anybody to do any real research. You have to say in advance what you\u2019re going to accomplish. You have to have milestones, reports. In Chaitin\u2019s view, a key problem is that the current system cannot afford failure \u2014 but the risk of some failures is often the price of later success.\n\nHow Stephen Wolfram revolutionized math computing. Wolfram has not made computers creative but he certainly took a lot of the drudgery out of the profession. Gregory Chaitin also discusses the amazing ideas early mathematicians developed without the software-based methods we are so lucky to have today.\n\nWhy Elon Musk, and others like him, can\u2019t afford to follow rules. Mathematician Gregory Chaitin explains why Elon Musk is, perhaps unexpectedly, his hero. Very creative people like Musk often have quirks and strange ideas (G\u00f6del and Cantor, for example) which do not prevent them from making major advances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Notes\n\n  \u2022 00:23\u00a0| Introducing Gregory Chaitin\n  \u2022 00:40\u00a0| What is unknowability?\n  \u2022 06:07\u00a0| Does non-computable mean unknowable?\n  \u2022 09:43\u00a0| A simple explanation\n  \u2022 21:34\u00a0| Is creativity non-computable?\n  \u2022 25:55\u00a0| Defining creativity\n  \u2022 28:19\u00a0| Panpsychism\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nPodcast Transcript Download\n\nMind Matters News\n\n\nThe Paradox of the Smallest Uninteresting Number<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>",

Therefore this formula is necessary to remove those spaces. This is of utmost importance, because a string without space such as \u201cIT\u201d and a string with irregular spaces at the end such as \u201cIT \u201c will not be treated as identical match in spreadsheet. Thus, if you do a lookup or countif function on \u201cIT\u201d, the \u201cIT \u201c will be neglected, lead to inaccurate outcome.\n\n\n\nThe result will be \u201cDESKTOP\u201d.\n\nThe text can be a reference to a cell.\n\nkeywords: Text, Data\n\nThursday, July 20, 2006\n\nFree Download: CFD Simulation Spreadsheet!\n\nThis spreadsheet allows you to enter the price of shares and outlay you ready to put in, and then work out your potential profit/loss depending if you go \u201cshort\u201d or \u201clong\u201d.\n\nPlease note yellow shaded cells are for data entry.\n\nDownload here.

This is very much like a condition, if condition is met then TRUE else FALSE.\n\nTherefore, in the above formula, if logical_test is TRUE, execute \u201coutcome if TRUE\u201d, else execute \u201coutcome if FALSE\u201d.\n\nAn example, assuming cell A2 is \u201c110\u201d and cell A3 is \u201c104\u201d\n\n=IF(A2>100,\u201dGreater than 100\u201d,\u201dLess than 100\u201d)\n\nThe result of the above formula will be \u201cGreater than 100\u201d\n\n=IF(A3>110,\u201dGreater than 110\u201d,\u201dLess than 110\u201d)\n\nThe result of the above formula will be \u201cLess than 110\u201d.\n\nKeyword: Logical\n\nWednesday, July 12, 2006\n\nLogical Function AND() & OR() in Excel\n\nThe AND formula returns TRUE if all arguments are TRUE and returns FALSE if one or more arguments are FALSE.

Such as:\n\n\nOther similar formulas are:\n\nISNA(value) check if a cell is #N/A\n\nApplication: =IF(ISNA(A2),\u201d\u201d,A1+A2)\n\nISERR(value) check if a cell is error except #N/A\n\nApplication: =IF(ISERR(A2),\u201d\u201d,A1+A2)\n\nISERROR(value) check if a cell is any types of error including #N/A\n\nApplication: =IF(ISERROR(A2),\u201d\u201d,A1+A2)\n\nISNUMBER(value) check if a cell is numerical\n\nApplication: =IF(ISNUMBER(A2),A1+A2,\u201d\u201d)\n\ncheck if a cell is text\n\nApplication: =IF(ISTEXT(A2),A2,A1+A2)\n\nSunday, July 09, 2006\n\nUsing COUNTBLANK to count number of blank cells\n\nThis formula counts the number of empty cells in a specified range of cells. It\u2019s a very straight-forward formula. This formula is one of the many Information formulas available in Excel.\n\nInformation formulas serve the purpose of returning all sorts of information regarding a table or a set of cells.\n\n\nRANGE is the range of cells to be counted. It could involve multiple rows and columns. Some examples are A2:C6 or A2:A50.\n\nFor instance, if range of cells A2:C6 has 2 blank cells. The outcome of COUNTBLANK(A2:C6) is 2.\n\nFriday, July 07, 2006\n\nUsing TODAY() to automatically update your spreadsheet dates\n\nThis is a relatively straight forward formula.\n\n\nBy putting this formula in a cell, the cell will display the current date.

Dec 8, 2005 #1\n    The Andromeda glaxaxy is two million light-years from earth, measured in the common rest frame of the earth and Andromeda. Suppose you took a fast spaceship to Andromeda, so it got you there in 50 years measured on the ship. If you sent a radio message home as soon as you reached Andromeda, how long after you left earth would it arrive, according to timekeepers on earth? Note that radio waves travel at the speed of light.\n\n\n    How do I go about this question?\n    With my own calculations I got a negative imaginary number. What I did was I found out the speed of the spaceship, and I got it to be 40000c. I'm not sure if this is right. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n  2. jcsd\n  3. Dec 8, 2005 #2\n    The spaceship cannot possibly travel faster than light, that's one of the consequences of Special Relativity's postulate that all inertial observers see the speed of light as constant, therefore its velocity relative to the Earth-Andromeda system must be some fraction of c. You need to use the proper Lorentzian time and distance formulas.\n  4. Dec 8, 2005 #3\n    with a speed of 40000c you've either found a space ship with warp drive, or you're wrong.\n    my assumption is the latter.\n\n    how did you find this speed?\n  5. Dec 8, 2005 #4\n    Thanks for the replies.\n    For the speed I used a light-years (ly) equation.\n    ly = cy (y is years)\n    c= ly / y\n    c= 2 000 000 / 50 years\n    c= 40 000\n    My hunch is also that this is wrong but I don't know what else to do.\n    dicerandom, do you mean Ls = gamma Lm? How do I use that in this situation? I need the speed for the gamma; do I not?\n  6. Dec 8, 2005 #5\n    no. c is a constant. it is \u2248 300 000m/s (in vaccuum).\n    also, you used thetime as measured ON THE SHIP. the ships clock runs slow from the PoV (Point of View) of the earth. how much slower?\n    that is up to you to find out.\n    note that the distance to Andromeda is also from the PoV of the earth.\n  7. Dec 8, 2005 #6\n    It is slower by a factor of gamma, right? The equation is t = gamma t' (t' being the 50 years). But I need a speed to solve for the gamma. How can I find out the speed of the spaceship?\n  8. Dec 8, 2005 #7\n    use the lorentz transformation for velocity.\n  9. Dec 8, 2005 #8\n    Is there any other way of doing it? My class hasn't learned the Lorentz Transformation.\n  10. Dec 8, 2005 #9\n    Your factor should be [tex]1/\\gamma[/tex], not [tex]\\gamma[/tex]. This is assuming that your book is using the standard definition of [tex]\\gamma[/tex]:\n\n\n    You then have the following transformation equations:\n\n    [tex]\\Delta t^\\prime = \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\gamma} = \\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2} \\Delta t[/tex]\n    [tex]\\Delta x^\\prime = \\gamma \\Delta x = \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}[/tex]\n\n    Think of the problem this way. You have two events, one of which is that the spaceship departed earth and the second is that the spaceship arrived at the andromeda galaxy. Think about where and when both of these events occured in both refrence frames and I think you'll find that you can use the equations above to reduce the problem to a system of two equations with two unknowns.\n    Last edited: Dec 8, 2005\n  11. Dec 8, 2005 #10\n    Thanks dicerandom but I have never come across the transformation equations that you mentioned. So shouldn't here be an alternative method of doing this problem?\n  12. Dec 8, 2005 #11\n    special relativity problem and you haven't come across these equations?\n    are you sure?\n  13. Dec 8, 2005 #12\n    There are many ways to solve it, I chose the method by which I first learned the theory since I thought perhaps your book followed a simmilar approach. Your book should have some simmilar equations to transform intervals and events between different refrence frames, read through the relevant section and use the equations that they provide.\n\n    What book are you using?\n  14. Dec 8, 2005 #13\n    Can I use the Galilean transformations for this?\n  15. Dec 8, 2005 #14\n    Oh nevermind dicer",
    "How Do I Study the Units and Measurements Chapter in Physics for the NEET?\n\nFor learners, NEET, or the National Eligibility as well as Entrance Test, is a prominent and hard exam. Students pay greater attention to this test, which covers a large number of topics from many chapters in different courses, such as physics, chemistry, as well as biology. As a result, some learners may get perplexed and fearful of the exam.\n\nThe official websites give well-organized material of Units and Measurements NEET Crucial Questions to assist avoid these misunderstandings, present clear ideas, and a well-structured approach to learning. This is how you study the chapter, use the questions to your advantage.\n\nIt describes and categorizes the questions that have a high priority and are more likely to be asked in the test. These critical questions are also created by examining previous year NEET question papers and taking into account the importance of each chapter in the NEET syllabus. For test preparation, look for that too so as to obtain the NEET Sample Paper, which will be very helpful too. The NEET essential questions on Units & Measurements are available online in PDF format for learners.\n\nIt is absolutely free and has been thoroughly revised by a physics professor with extensive expertise. This content assists students in determining which ideas are the most significant, as well as providing relevant explanations as well as examples for these topics.\n\nUnits and Measurements\n\nPhysics is a science in which the goal is to prove something, whether qualitatively or quantitatively. As a result, if it wishes to describe something quantitatively, it will require certain units as well as measures. The focus of this section is to describe the same thing. Measurements and Units NEET in 11th grade Questions provide adequate examples to illustrate various units, ways of representing those units, measurements, transformations, notations, and so on. The PDF discusses and clarifies the differences between concepts such as basic units, derived units, as well as a system of units such as:\n\n  \u2022 Centimetre \u2013 gram \u2013 second\n  \u2022 Meter \u2013 kilogram \u2013 second\n  \u2022 Foot \u2013 pound \u2013 second\n\nInternational System of Units\n\nThe Units and Measurements NEET questions are created to describe and provide the questions that are most likely to appear on the test. The propagation of mistakes and the parallax angle approach are two of the most critical of these concerns. These can be conveyed in simple terms by experienced professors in the region, according to notes PDF here on main Doubtnut\u00a0website. It is simple for students to practise multiple-choice questions if they have sufficient understanding of all topics covered in all chapters of the subject. NEET central themes on units and measurements teach students how to solve multiple-choice questions that arise often in the necessary test. Let\u2019s look at some basic definitions and important information.\n\n  \u2022 Measurement: The measuring procedure is essentially a comparative process. To determine how several times a standard amount of a physical quantity is represented in the quantity being measured, we must first determine how many instances a fixed sum of that physical quantity is contained in the measuring instruments. The magnitude of the number obtained is termed the unit of the physical quantity, and the standard used is called the unit of the physical quantity.\n\n\n  \u2022 Unit: A physical quantity\u2019s unit is an arbitrarily defined standard that is commonly recognised by society and may be used to measure other physical quantities of comparable kind.\n\n\n  \u2022 Standard: A standard of a physical quantity is the real physical manifestation of that physical quantity\u2019s unit. We require the numerical value (n) as well as the unit (\u03bc)\u00a0to represent any measurement. Physical amount measurement = Numerical value x Unit.\n\n\n  \u2022 Physical Quantity/Units at a Basic Level: It is a fundamental physical quantity that may be expressed without the need of any other physical quantity. It can\u2019t be resolved any further in terms of another physical quantity. It\u2019s also known as the fundamental physical quantity. Basic units are the units of fundamental physical quantities. Mass, Length, and Time are essential units of the M. K. S. system, for example, and are represented in kilogrammes, metres, and seconds, respectively.\n  \u2022 Physical Quantity/Units Derived: The phrase \u201cderived physical quantities\u201d refers to all physical quantities that may be derived from the fusion of multiple or even more fundamental values or represented in terms of basic physical quantities. Most other physical quantities\u2019 units, that may be derived using basic units, are referred to as derived units. Units of velocity, density, as well as force, for example, being m/s, kg/m3, and kg m/s2, correspondingly, and therefore are instances of derived units.\n\nDo you know the answer of the below question?\n\n\n\nAs a result, the NEET Units and Measurements Key Questions present a series of important multiple-choice questions that assist students in solving and answering questions quickly throughout the NEET test. It also allows students to achieve a high score on this quantitative test while simultaneously demonstrating excellent understanding.\n\nYou May Also Like\n\nAbout the Author: Saloni singh\n\nLeave a Reply\n<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>"
