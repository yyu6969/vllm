The weights in the conv layers should be exactly the same size per batch for the test data as train/valid data. And there should never be more than one batch in memory at any one time. I have reduced my batch size from 64 to 8 just to make sure and still get memory error.\n\nMy guess is that there is some sort of memory leak inside predict_generator where it is using up memory for each batch. If so then the answer is to run the predict and save after each batch as you have done; or maybe run it in 4 chunks and save after each.\n\n\nAh my mistake!!.. I was thinking the output features were 70K10 as they would be from the whole model. However the output of the conv layers is 70K5121414.\n\nAlso the space taken up by python numbers is bigger than I realised:\n\n  \u2022 28 bytes per int\n  \u2022 24 bytes per float\n  \u2022 8 bytes np.array per cell (plus overhead less some compression for zeros I think?)\n\nAnyway there is no memory leak here. The output is massive so the only answer is to save it as you go along.\n\n(avi) #148\n\ni got 98 precent in 4 epochs and i tested it -\nit works\n\n(avi) #149\n\nvery simple model 98 precent in 4 epochs.\ni skipped the import at start so here is the rest of the code:\n\nfrom keras.layers.convolutional import Conv2D\nfrom keras.layers.pooling import MaxPooling2D \nfrom keras.layers.normalization import BatchNormalization\nmodel = Sequential()\n\nmodel.add(Conv2D(16, 3, input_shape = (32, 32, 3), activation = 'relu'))\n\nmodel.add(Conv2D(16, 3,  activation = 'relu'))\nmodel.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2), strides=(2,2)))\n\nmodel.add(Conv2D(32, 3,  activation = 'relu'))       \n\n\nfrom keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator\n\ntrain_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale = 1./255,\n                                   shear_range = 0.1,\n                                   zoom_range = 0.1,\n\ntest_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale = 1./255)\n\ntraining_set = train_datagen.flow_from_directory('train',\n                                                 target_size = (32, 32),\n                                                 batch_size = 4,\n                                                 class_mode = 'categorical')\n\ntest_set = test_datagen.flow_from_directory('val',\n                                            target_size = (32, 32),\n                                            batch_size = 4,\n                                            class_mode = 'categorical')\nmodel.compile(optimizer=SGD(lr=0.01, momentum=0.0, decay=0.0, nesterov=False), loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])\n\n                         steps_per_epoch = 22400/4,\n                         epochs = 2,\n                         validation_data = test_set,\n                         validation_steps = 4000/4)`\n\n(Virgil E.

We talk about this technique a bit in lessons 9 and 10, so you\u2019ll be ahead of the curve when you get there :slight_smile:\n\n(Rob Forgione) #152\n\nI\u2019m only on lesson 4, so apologize if this question is just getting ahead of myself \u2013 but I did a little reading on the winning entry, and it looks like the foundation is a single Vgg16 model which got the participant to a leaderboard score of 0.3 (the winner then did a bunch of other cool stuff to get down to #1). This is very impressive to me as I\u2019ve battled to get a private leaderboard score of 0.68 (public 0.81), and can\u2019t seem to get beyond this threshold. I was wondering if anyone had tips / tricks to get a better score with a single vgg model? Has anyone achieved a score anywhere close to the 0.3 range with a single vgg? Would love to hear your thoughts / approaches!\n\n\nThanks, chris, for sharing this!\n\nTo whom it may concern\u2026 I changed the function a litte to make it more transparent to me what I am doing. This moves the first three drivers to the validation set:\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(path + 'driver_imgs_list.csv')\ndf.columns = (\"driver\", \"label\", \"filename\")\ndrivers = df.driver.unique()\n\nval_drivers = drivers[:3]\n\ngrouped = df.groupby('driver')\n\nfor val_d in val_drivers:\n    df_driver = grouped.get_group(val_d)\n\n    for (subject, cls, img) in df_driver.values:\n        source = '{}_train/{}/{}'.format(path, cls, img)\n        target = source.replace('_train', '_validate')\n        print('mv {} {}'.format(source, target))\n        os.rename(source, target)\n\n(Arman Sharafshahi) #154\n\nI created a little notebook that allows me to create various train/validation splits (default of 5 folds) where the training and validation data always contain separate drivers. It yields roughly an 80/20 data split each time. This could be used to create a 5-model ensemble for example by re-configuring train/val between each training run.\n\n\n\nIn the statefarm problem, I tried using transfer learning with the help of keras\u2019s vgg16 model. When I shuffle the training data (set shuffle = True), the accuracy I get on training data is abysmal. When shuffle = False, I get a good training accuracy. Why does setting shuffle = True in get_batches() on the train data cause such differences in accuracy? Shouldn\u2019t shuffle=True lead to better accuracy?\n\nThe code I have used is as follows:\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom keras.preprocessing import image\nfrom keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator\nfrom keras.models import Sequential\nfrom keras.layers import Dropout, Flatten, Dense\nfrom keras.applications import VGG16\nfrom keras.utils.np_utils import to_categorical\n\n\nbatch_size = 64\n\ndatagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1. / 255)\n\ndef get_batches(dirname, gen = image.ImageDataGenerator(), shuffle=True, batch_size=batch_size):        \n    batch_gen = gen.flow_from_directory(dirname, target_size=(224,224), \n            class_mode='categorical', shuffle=shuffle, batch_size=batch_size)    \n    num_batch = len(batch_gen)\n    return batch_gen, num_batch\n\ngenerator, num_train_batches = get_batches('./data/train', gen=datagen, shuffle=False)\n\ntrain_labels = to_categorical(generator.classes)\n\ntrain_data = model.predict_generator(generator, num_train_batches)\n\ngenerator, num_valid_batches = get_batches('./data/valid', gen=datagen,\n                                                shuffle=False, batch_size=batch_size * 2)\n\nvalidation_labels = to_categorical(generator.classes)\n\nmodel = Sequential()\n\n              loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy']) = 1e-5, train_labels,\n          validation_data=(validation_data, validation_labels), verbose=1)\n\nWhen shuffle=False:-\nTrain on 17968 samples, validate on 4456 samples\nEpoch 1/5\n17968/17968 [==============================] - 4s 224us/step - loss: 1.7476 - acc: 0.4617 - val_loss: 1.4700 - val_acc: 0.6914\nEpoch 2/5\n17968/17968 [==============================] - 4s 197us/step - loss: 0.7867 - acc: 0.8535 - val_loss: 1.0974 - val_acc: 0.7417\nEpoch 3/5\n17968/17968 [==============================] - 4s 197us/step - loss: 0.4472 - acc: 0.9335 - val_loss: 0.9330 - val_acc: 0.7554\nEpoch 4/5\n17968/17968 [==============================] - 4s 199us/step - loss: 0.2926 - acc: 0.9613 - val_loss: 0.8638 - val_acc: 0.7655\nEpoch 5/5\n17968/17968 [==============================] - 4s 197us/step - loss: 0.2131 - acc: 0.9726 - val_loss: 0.8067 - val_acc: 0.7747\n\nWhen shuffle=True:\nTrain on 17968 samples, validate on 4456 samples\nEpoch 1/5\n17968/17968 [==============================] - 4s 215us/step - loss: 2.3914 - acc: 0.0995 - val_loss: 2.2935 - val_acc: 0.1086\nEpoch 2/5\n17968/17968 [==============================] - 4s 201us/step - loss: 2.3025 - acc: 0.1113 - val_loss: 2.2982 - val_acc: 0.1241\nEpoch 3/5\n17968/17968 [==============================] - 4s 199us/step - loss: 2.2991 - acc: 0.1182 - val_loss: 2.2997 - val_acc: 0.0866\nEpoch 4/5\n17968/179",

Python strings are array of characters or any group of characters defined between double quotes or single quotes.\n\nFor example, \u201cThis is a string\u201d or \u2018This is a string\u2019.\n\nThe characters in the string are stored in the consecutive memory location as the string is treated as an array of characters. Each character occupies 1 byte in the memory heap.\n\nPython strings are also immutable, meaning they cannot be modified once created.\n\nCreating Python Strings\n\nCreating strings in Python is as simple as assigning a value to the variable. The value that is being assigned must be in either within double quotes \" \" or single quotes ' ' for the string.\n\nA string literal can be of multiple lines as well. In such cases, triple quotes are used.\n\nHere are the examples to demonstrate Python strings.\n\n>>> #using single quotes\n>>> py_str = 'YOLO'\n>>> print (py_str)\n>>> #using double quotes\n>>> py_str = \"Hey there\"\n>>> print (py_str)\nHey there\n>>> #using triple quotes for multiple line strings\n>>> py_str = \"\"\" This is first line\n                 and this is second line.\"\"\"\n>>> print (py_str)\nThis is first line\n          and this is second line.\n\nHow to concatenate strings in Python?\n\nConcatenation means joining two or more strings together.\n\nIn Python, this is achieved by using + operator.\n\n>>> #concatenating two strings\n>>> py_str = \"Hi\" + \"there\"\n>>> print (py_str)\nHi there\n\n>>> #concatenating multiple strings\n>>> py_str  = \"Hi\" + \"there\" + \"programmers\"\n>>> print (py_str)\nHi there programmers\n>>> #using concatenating + and assignment operator =\n>>> x = \"Python\"\n>>> y = \"Strings\"\n>>> x += y  #this is equivalent to x = x + y\n>>> print(x)\nPython Strings\n\nHow to calculate the length of a string?\n\nPython has built-in function len(string_name) which calculates and return the length of a string supplied as an argument.\n\n>>> #using len() to find length of a string\n>>> py_str = \"YOLO YOLO\"\n>>> print (len(py_str))  #to print the length of string\n\nHere in the example, the length of the string is 9 because it also counts the whitespace in between.\n\nHow to access characters in a Python string?\n\nOnce we create Python string, we can\u2019t modify them but we can access the characters in the string and use them in further operations.\n\nIn Python, individual characters or elements are accessed using indexing and a range of characters or string slices are accessed using slicing. Before jumping into examples, let us first know about indexing and slicing.\n\n\nWhat is indexing?\n\nIndexing actually means locating an element from a Python sequence (list, string, tuple, dictionary or any) by its position in that sequence. This indexing starts from zero meaning the first element of the sequence holds the index '0'.\n\nPython has indexing operator\u00a0'[ ]'.\n\nThere are two ways we can index string or any sequence in Python:\n\n  \u2022 index with positive integers:\u00a0Index from left starting with 0 and 0 being the index of the first item in the\u00a0string or sequence\n  \u2022 index with negative integer:\u00a0Index from the right starting with -1 and -1\u00a0being the index of the last item in the string or sequence.\n\nFor example, consider the following string with 4 characters.\n\npy_str = \"abcd\"\n\nNow, if we index with positive integers using the indexing operator\u00a0'[ ]':\n\npy_str[0] = apy_str[1] = bpy_str[2] = cpy_str[3] = d\n\nAnd if we index with negative integers, then\n\npy_str[-1] = dpy_str[-2] = cpy_str[-3] = bpy_str[-4] = a\n\nNote: Only integers are allowed in indexing.\n\nCommon Programming Errors\nTrying to access 5th character in the string of 4 characters will raise an error saying:\u00a0IndexError: String index\u00a0out\u00a0of\u00a0range. And also using floating point numbers instead of integers to index will also raise an error saying:\u00a0TypeError\n\nWhat is Slicing in Python?\n\nSlicing as the meaning goes is basically chopping or retrieving a set of values from a particular sequence.\n\nIn slicing we define a starting point to start retrieving the values, an endpoint to stop retrieving (the endpoint value is not included) and the step size. Step size is by default 1, if not mentioned explicitly.\n\nAnd the retrieved set of characters from the string is known as Python slices.\n\n\nNow that we know about indexing and slicing, let\u2019s learn about using slicing and indexing to access characters from Python strings with examples.\n\n  \u2022 To access single character: Indexing\n\nWhere index_char is the index of the character to be accessed from string py_str.\n\nFor example, if we have a string named\u00a0py_str, we can access its\u00a05th character by using\u00a0py_str[4]\u00a0as the indexing starts from 0.\n\n  \u2022 To access a range of character or a segment of the string: Slicing\n\nThis will return characters starting from mth character to the nth character from the string excluding\u00a0nth character.\n\n\n>>> py_str = \"Programming\"\n>>> #accessing 4th character using positive integer\n>>> print (py_str[3]) #remember indexing starts from 0\n>>> #accessing 3rd character from right using negative integer\n>>> print (py_str[-3])  #indexing from right starts with -1\n>>> #slicing out 1st character to 7th character\n>>> print (py_str[0:7]  #if not mentioned step size is 1\n>>> #slicing 1st character to 5th last\n>>> print (py_str[0:-4])\n>>> #to access whole string\n>>> print (py_str[:])\n>>> #to slice out whole string starting from 2nd character\n>>> print (py_str[1:])\n\nIterating through \u00a0the string in Python\n\nIterating through Python strings using for loop.\n\npy_str = \"Hey\"\ncount = 1\nfor alphabets in py_str:\n  print (alphabets)\n  count = count+1\n\n\nThis will generate following output.\n\n\nNow let\u2019s write another example using while loop to check if a character is present in the string or not.\n\npy_str = \"trytoprogram\"\nl = len(py_str)\ncount = 0\nwhile count<l:\n  if py_str[count] == 'o':\n     print ('character found')\n  count = count+1\n\n\nThis will generate following output.\n\ncharacter found\n\nPython String formatting: Escape characters\n\nAn escape character is a non-printable character which is represented with a backslash '\\' and are interpreted differently.\n\nWhen do we need escape sequences?\n\nWell, we need escape sequences in many things while coding. Here is one example.\n\nIn Python, a double quoted string literal can easily have a single quote in between and a single quote string can have a double quote in between.\n\nBut, what if we have both double quotes and single quotes in a string.\n\nlet us consider following example.\n\n>>> print (\"Gary said-\"I don't like cats\".\")\n\nSyntaxError : invalid syntax\n\nThat generated error called SyntaxError : invalid syntax.\n\nThat is because when the interpreter encountered closing double quote at I, it interpreted as the end of the string, hence generating the syntax error.\n\nWe can address such errors with triple quotes, but when triple quotes occur in between the string, it will again generate the error.\n\nSo, escape sequences are used to generate quotes in such cases. Here is the example demonstrating the solution using escape sequences.\n\n>>> #using triple quotes\n>>> print (\"\"\" Gary said-\"I don't like cats\".\"\"\" )\nGary said-\"I don't like cats\".\n>>> #using escape sequences \\\" for printing double quotes and \\' for single quotes\n>>> print (\"Gary said-\\\"I don\\'t like cats\\\".\")\nGary said-\"I don't like cats\".\n\nHere is the list of escape sequences in Python.\n\n\\newlineNewline ignored\n\\\\Backslash ( \\ )\n\\\u2019Single quote ( \u2018 )\n\\\u201dDouble quote ( \u201d )\n\\aASCII bell or alert\n\\bASCII backspace\n\\fASCII form feed\n\\nASCII\u00a0line feed\n\\rASCII\u00a0carriage return\n\\tASCII\u00a0horizontal tab\n\\vASCII\u00a0vertical tab\n\\oooASCII\u00a0character with octal value ooo\n\\xhhASCII\u00a0character with hexadecimal value hh\n\nPython built-in methods for string manipulation\n\nPython has many built-in functions or methods for the manipulation of strings. Here is the tabulated list of Python methods for string manipulation.\n\nPython built-in methods with description\nall( str)\nIt returns true if all the elements in the iterable are true.\nany(str )\nIt returns true if any element in the iterable are true.\nascii(str )\nIt returns printable version of string \u2018str\u2019.\ncapitalize( )\nIt capitalizes the first letter of the string.\ncenter( )\nReturns a space-padded string with the specified character.\nCounts how many times m\u00a0occurs in a string.\ndecode(encoding=\u2019UTF-8\u2032, errors=\u2019strict\u2019)\nIt decodes the string using the codec registered for encoding.\nencode(encoding=\u2019UTF-8\u2032, errors=\u2019strict\u2019)\nIt returns encoded version of the string.\nChecks if the string ends with specified character or suffix.\nExpands tabs in string with\u00a0multiple spaces.\nDetermine if \u2018str\u2019 is present in string or not.\nReturns the index of substring \u2018str\u2019 but raises an exception if \u2018str\u2019 not found.\nisalnum( )\nReturns true if string has at least 1 character and all characters are alphanumeric and false otherwise.\nisalpha( )\nReturns true if string has alphanumeric character.\nisdigit( )\nChecks\u00a0if string contains only digits..\nislower( )\nReturns true if string has lowercase characters.\nisnumeric( )\nReturns true if the string contains only numeric digits.\nisspace( )\nIt is used to check whitespace in the string.\nistitle( )\nChecks if a string is properly titlecased or not.

The aggregation of platelets in blood to form a plug on an injured surface of a blood vessel occurs after sequential activation of at least ten different enzymes which are normally present in blood as inactive precursors.\u00a0 Human platelets are composed of one major phospholipid, 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonyl phosphatidylinositol.\u00a0 The components of the phospholipid are stearic acid (18:0), arachidonic acid (20:4 all cis \\(\\Delta ^{5,8,11,14}\\)), glycerol, phosphate, and inositol (structure shown below).\n\na) In the space below, draw the complete structure of the phospholipid 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonyl phosphatidylinositol, given that the linkage of inositol to the phosphatidate involves the hydroxyl group on carbon 1 of inositol.\u00a0 (SHOW ALL BONDS).\n\nb) Sonication of the phospholipid described in part a) would most likely lead to the formation of (micelles, liposomes, two insoluble liquid phases).\u00a0 CIRCLE BEST ANSWER.\u00a0 Based on your answer, provide a diagrammatic description of the structures, if any, that would form upon sonication of this phospholipid.\u00a0 With your answer, please identify which of the components of the phospholipid will be exposed to the aqueous environment.\n\n\n2.

The acid-base properties of oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin from a particular mammal can be described by the following two equilibrium expressions:\n\n\\(\\begin{matrix} \\mathrm{Oxyhemoglobin\\: HHbO_{2} \\Leftrightarrow H^{+}+HbO_{2}} & \\mathrm{pK_{a}=6.2}\\\\ \\mathrm{Deoxyhemoglobin\\: HHb \\Leftrightarrow H^{+}+Hb}& \\mathrm{pK_{a}=7.7} \\end{matrix}\\)\n\na) For each statement below place the letter \"D\" in the space provided if the statement is true of Deoxyhemoglobin, and the letter \"O\" if the statement is true of Oxyhemoglobin, or \"D and O\" if the statement is true for both proteins.\n\nD and O \u00a0 This form of Hb exhibits quaternary structure.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0O\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0This form of Hb is a stronger acid than the other form.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0D\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 At pH 6.5 this form of Hb binds more protons (mol\u00a0\\(\\mathrm{H^{+}}\\)/mole Hb) than the other form of Hb.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0O\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 This form of Hb has a lower affinity for 2,3 - bisphosphoglycerate (BPG) than the other form.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 D\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 As the \\(\\mathrm{P_{O_{2}}}\\) level is increased and the pH is kept constant, the concentration of this form of Hb will decrease.\n\nb) A BIS102 student prepared 1 L of a 2 mM solution of the hemoglobin described above at pH 7.4 and measured its oxygen saturation to be 80%.\u00a0 Calculate the concentration of all of the forms of hemoglobin (i. e.\\(\\mathrm{ Hb,\\: HHb,\\: HbO_{2}, HHbO_{2}}\\)) which will be found under these conditions.\n\n\\[\\mathbf{total\\: oxy\\: form=0.8\\times 2\\: mM=1.6\\: mM}\\]\n\n\\[\\begin{matrix} \\mathbf{7.4=6.2+log\\dfrac{[HbO_{2}]}{[HHbO_{2}]}} & \\mathbf{[HbO_{2}]+[HHbO_{2}]=1.6}\\\\ \\:\u00a0& \\mathbf{15.8[HHbO_{2}]+[HHBO_{2}]=1.6}\\\\ \\mathbf{\\dfrac{[HbO_{2}]}{[HHbO_{2}]}=15.8}& \\mathbf{16.8[HHbO_{2}]=1.6}\\\\ \\mathbf{[HbO_{2}]=15.8[HHbO_{2}]}& \\mathbf{[HHbO_{2}]=0.1\\: mM,\\: [HbO_{2}]=1.5\\: mM} \\end{matrix}\\]\n\n\n\\[\\mathbf{total\\: deoxy\\: form=0.2\\times 2\\: mM=0.4\\: mM}\\]\n\n\\[\\begin{matrix} \\mathbf{7.4=7.7+log\\dfrac{[Hb]}{[HHB]}}& \\mathbf{[Hb]+[HHb]=-0.4\\: mM}\\\\ \\: & \\mathbf{1.5[HHb]=0.4}\\\\ \\mathbf{[Hb]=0.5[HHb]}& \\mathbf{[HHb]=0.27\\: mM,\\: [Hb]=0.13\\: mM} \\end{matrix}\\]\n\nc) The degree of oxygen saturation of hemoglobin can be used to monitor the production or consumption of \\(\\mathrm{H^{+}}\\) ions by a metabolic reaction.\u00a0 A change of oxygen saturation of the 0.002 M hemoglobin solution described in part \"b\" from 80% to 50% saturation indicates the (production or consumption) of \\(\\mathrm{H^{+}}\\) ions by a metabolic reaction taking place in the same tube.\u00a0 (Circle best answer).\u00a0 Assume a constant \\(\\mathrm{P_{O_{2}}}\\) level.\u00a0 Explain.\n\nThe solution changed from 80% saturated to 50% saturation, therefore O2 was released by the hemoglobin.\u00a0 An increase in [\\(\\mathbf{H^{+}}\\)] favors the deoxy form, therefore \\(\\mathbf{H^{+}}\\) must have been produced in the metabolic process to shift the equilibrium from \\(\\mathbf{HbO_{2}}\\) to Hb.\n\nd) Calculate the number of moles of \\(\\mathrm{O_{2}}\\) released by the 1 L of hemoglobin solution described in part \"c\" when the oxygen saturation is changed from 80% to 50%.\u00a0 Provide a rationale for your answer based on the structure of hemoglobin.\n\nBefore the reaction 80% of the Hb had O2 bound, after the reaction 50% had O2 bound.\u00a0 Therefore:\n\n80%-50%=30%\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0\\(\\mathbf{HbO_{2}}\\)\u00a0released\u00a0its\u00a0\\(\\mathbf{O_{2}}\\).\n\n\\[\\mathbf{0.3\\times 0.002\\: mol=0.0006\\: moles\\: of\\: HbO_{2}\\: released\\: its\\: O_{2}.}\\]\n\n\\[\\mathbf{4O_{2}\\: are\\: released\\: from\\: each\\: HbO_{2}\\: so:}\\]\n\n\\[\\mathbf{4\\times 0.0006\\: moles=0.0024\\: moles\\: of\\: O_{2}\\: released\\: (2.4\\: mmoles).}\\]\n\n\n7.\u00a0 Briefly describe the purpose of each of the following biochemical techniques (e. g. \u201ca method to separate carbohydrates on the basis of glucose content\u201d).
