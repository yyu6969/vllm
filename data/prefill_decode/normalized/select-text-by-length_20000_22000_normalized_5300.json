Metaparse works with compilers using C++98, but the input of the parsers has to be defined the way it is described above.\n\nBased on constexpr, a feature provided by C++11, Metaparse provides a macro, BOOST_METAPARSE_STRING for defining strings:\n\n\nThis defines a string as well, however, it is easier to read. The maximum length of the string that can be defined this way is limited, however, this limit is configurable. It is specified by the BOOST_METAPARSE_LIMIT_STRING_SIZE macro.\n\nA source position is described using a compile-time data structure. The following functions can be used to query it:\n\nThe beginning of the input is start which requires <boost/metaparse/start.hpp> to be included.\n\nAn error is described using a compile-time data structure. It contains information about the source position where the error was detected and some description about the error. debug_parsing_error can be used to display the error message. Metaparse provides the BOOST_METAPARSE_DEFINE_ERROR macro for defining simple parsing error messages.\n\n  \u2022 A parser that parses nothing and always succeeds is return_.\n  \u2022 A parser that always fails is fail.\n  \u2022 A parser that parses one character and returns the parsed character as the result is one_char.\n\nComplex parsers can be built by combining simple parsers. The parser library contains a number of parser combinators that build new parsers from already existing ones.\n\nFor example accept_when<Parser, Predicate, RejectErrorMsg> is a parser. It uses Parser to parse the input. When Parser rejects the input, the combinator returns the error Parser failed with. When Parser is successful, the combinator validates the result using Predicate. If the predicate returns true, the combinator accepts the input, otherwise it generates an error with the message RejectErrorMsg.\n\nHaving accept_when, one_char can be used to build parsers that accept only digit characters, only whitespaces, etc. For example digit accepts only digit characters:\n\n\nThe result of a successful parsing is some value and the remaining string that was not parsed. The remaining string can be processed by another parser. The parser library provides a parser combinator, sequence, that takes a number of parsers as arguments and builds a new parser from them that:\n\n  \u2022 Parses the input using the first parser\n  \u2022 If parsing succeeds, it parses the remaining string with the second parser\n  \u2022 It continues applying the parsers in order as long as they succeed\n  \u2022 If all of them succeed, it returns the list of results\n  \u2022 If any of the parsers fails, the combinator fails as well and returns the error the first failing parser returned with\n\nIt is a common thing to parse a list of things of unknown length. As an example let's start with something simple: the text is a list of numbers. For example:\n\n11 13 3 21\n\nWe want the result of parsing to be the sum of these values. Metaparse provides the int_ parser we can use to parse one of these numbers. Metaparse provides the token combinator to consume the whitespaces after the number. So the following parser parses one number and the whitespaces after it:\n\nusing int_token = token<int_>;\n\nThe result of parsing is a boxed integer value: the value of the parsed number. For example parsing BOOST_METAPARSE_STRING(\"13 \") gives boost::mpl::int_<13> as the result.\n\nOur example input is a list of numbers. Each number can be parsed by int_token:\n\nThis diagram shows how the repeated application of int_token can parse the example input. Metaparse provides the repeated parser to easily implement this. The result of parsing is a typelist: the list of the individual numbers.\n\nThis diagram shows how repeated<int_token> works. It uses the int_token parser repeatedly and builds a boost::mpl::vector from the results it provides.\n\nBut we need the sum of these, so we need to summarise the result. We can do this by wrapping our parser, repeated<int_token> with transform. That gives us the opportunity to specify a function transforming this typelist to some other value - the sum of the elements in our case. Initially let's ignore how to summarise the elements in the vector. Let's assume that it can be implemented by a lambda expression and use boost::mpl::lambda<...>::type representing that lambda expression. Here is an example using transform and this lambda expression:\n\nusing sum_parser =\n\nThe transform<> parser combinator wraps the repeated<int_token> to build the parser we need. Here is a diagram showing how it works:\n\nAs the diagram shows, the transform<repeated<int_token>, ...> parser parses the input using repeated<int_token> and then does some processing on the result of parsing.\n\nLet's implement the missing lambda expression that tells transform how to change the result coming from repeated<int_token>. We can summarise the numbers in a typelist by using Boost.MPL's fold or accumulate. Here is an example doing that:\n\nusing sum_op = mpl::lambda<mpl::plus<mpl::_1, mpl::_2>>::type;\n\nusing sum_parser =\n      mpl::fold<mpl::_1, mpl::int_<0>, sum_op>\n\nHere is an extended version of the above diagram showing what happens here:\n\nThis example parses the input, builds the list of numbers and then loops over it and summarises the values. It starts with the second argument of fold, int_<0> and adds every item of the list of numbers (which is the result of the parser repeated<int_token>) one by one.\n\n[Note] Note\n\nNote that transform wraps another parser, repeated<int_token> here. It parses the input with that parser, gets the result of that parsing and changes that result. transform itself will be a parser returning that updated result.\n\nIt works, however, this is rather inefficient: it has a loop parsing the integers one by one, building a typelist and then it loops over this typelist to summarise the result. Using template metaprograms in your applications can have a serious impact on the compiler's memory usage and the speed of the compilation, therefore I recommend being careful with these things.\n\nMetaparse offers more efficient ways of achieving the same result. You don't need two loops: you can merge them together and add every number to your summary right after parsing it. Metaparse offers the foldl for this.\n\nWith foldl you specify:\n\n  \u2022 the parser to parse the individual elements of the list (which is int_token in our example)\n  \u2022 the initial value used for folding (which is int_<0> in our example)\n  \u2022 the forward operation merging the sub-result we have so far and the value coming from the last application of the parser (this was sum_op in our example)\n\nOur parser can be implemented this way:\n\nusing better_sum_parser = foldl<int_token, mpl::int_<0>, sum_op>;\n\nAs you can see the implementation of the parser is more compact. Here is a diagram showing what happens when you use this parser to parse some input:\n\nAs you can see, not only the implementation of the parser is more compact, but it achieves the same result by doing less as well. It parses the input by applying int_token repeatedly, just like the previous solution. But it produces the final result without building a typelist as an internal step. Here is how it works internally:\n\nIt summarises the results of the repeated int_token application using sum_op. This implementation is more efficient. It accepts an empty string as a valid input: the sum of it is 0. It may be good for you, in which case you are done. If you don't wan to accept it, you can use foldl1 instead of foldl. This is the same, but it rejects empty input. (Metaparse offers repeated1 as well if you choose the first approach and would like to reject empty string)\n\n[Note] Note\n\nNote that if you are reading this manual for the first time, you probably want to skip this section and proceed with Introducing foldl_start_with_parser\n\nYou might have noticed that Metaparse offers foldr as well. The difference between foldl and foldr is the direction in which the results are summarised. (l stands for from the Left and r stands for from the Right) Here is a diagram showing how better_sum_parser works if it is implemented using foldr:\n\nAs you can see this is very similar to using foldl, but the results coming out of the individual applications of int_token are summarised in a right-to-left order. As sum_op is addition, it does not affect the end result, but in other cases it might.\n\n[Note] Note\n\nNote that the implementation of foldl is more efficient than foldr. Prefer foldl whenever possible.\n\nAs you might expect it, Metaparse offers foldr1 as well, which folds from the right and rejects empty input.\n\nLet's change the grammar of our little language. Instead of a list of numbers, let's expect numbers separated by a + symbol. Our example input becomes the following:\n\nBOOST_METAPARSE_STRING(\"11 + 13 + 3 + 21\")\n\nParsing it with foldl or repeated is difficult: there has to be a + symbol before every element except the first one. None of the already introduced repetition constructs offer a way of treating the first element in a different way.\n\nIf we forget about the first number for a moment, the rest of the input is \"+ 13 + 3 + 21\". This can easily be parsed by foldl (or repeated):\n\nusing plus_token = token<lit_c<'+'>>;\nusing plus_int = last_of<plus_token, int_token>;\n\nusing sum_parser2 = foldl<plus_int, int_<0>, sum_op>;\n\nIt uses plus_int, that is last_of<plus_token, int_token> as the parser that is used repeatedly to get the numbers. It does the following:\n\n  \u2022 Uses plus_token to parse the + symbol and any whitespace that might follow it.\n  \u2022 Uses then int_token to parse the number\n  \u2022 Combines the above two with last_of to use both parsers in order and keep only the result of using the second one (the result of parsing the + symbol is thrown away - we don't care about it).\n\nThis way last_of<plus_token, int_token> returns the value of the number as the result of parsing, just like our previous parser, int_token did. Because of this, it can be used as a drop-in replacement of int_token in the previous example and we get a parser for our updated language. Or at least for all number except the first one.\n\nThis foldl can not parse the first element, because it expects a + symbol before every number. You might think of making the + symbol optional in the above approach - don't do that. It makes the parser accept \"11 + 13 3 21\" as well as the + symbol is now optional everywhere.\n\nWhat you could do is parsing the first element with int_token, the rest of the elements with the above foldl-based solution and add the result of the two. This is left as an exercise to the reader.\n\nMetaparse offers foldl_start_with_parser to implement this. foldl_start_with_parser is the same as foldl. The difference is that instead of an initial value to combine the list elements with it takes an initial parser:\n\nusing plus_int = last_of<plus_token, int_token>;\n\nusing sum_parser3 = foldl_start_with_parser<plus_int, int_token, sum_op>;\n\nfoldl_start_with_parser starts with applying that initial parser and uses the result it returns as the initial value for folding. It does the same as foldl after that. The following diagram shows how it can be used to parse a list of numbers separated by + symbols:\n\nAs the diagram shows, it start parsing the list of numbers with int_token, uses its value as the starting value for folding (earlier approaches were using the value int_<0> as this starting value). Then it parses all elements of the list by using plus_int multiple times.\n\n[Note] Note\n\nNote that if you are reading this manual for the first time, you probably want to skip this section and try creating some parsers using foldl_start_with_parser instead.\n\nfoldl_start_with_parser has its from the right pair, foldr_start_with_parser. It uses the same elements as foldl_start_with_parser but in a different order. Here is a parser for our example language implemented with foldr_start_with_parser:\n\nusing int_plus = first_of<int_token, plus_token>;\n\nusing sum_parser4 = foldr_start_with_parser<int_plus, int_token, sum_op>;\n\nNote that it uses int_plus instead of plus_int. This is because the parser the initial value for folding comes from is used after int_plus has parsed the input as many times as it could. It might sound strange for the first time, but the following diagram should help you understand how it works:\n\nAs you can see, it starts with the parser that is applied repeatedly on the input, thus instead of parsing plus_token int_token repeatedly, we need to parse int_token plus_token repeatedly. The last number is not followed by +, thus int_plus fails to parse it and it stops the iteration. foldr_start_with_parser then uses the other parser, int_token to parse the input. It succeeds and the result it returns is used as the starting value for folding from the right.\n\n[Note] Note\n\nNote that as the above description also suggests, the implementation of foldl_start_with_parser is more efficient than foldr_start_with_parser. Prefer foldl_start_with_parser whenever possible.\n\nUsing a parser built with foldl_start_with_parser we can parse the input when the input is correct. However, it is not always the case. Consider the following input for example:\n\nBOOST_METAPARSE_STRING(\"11 + 13 + 3 + 21 +\")\n\nThis is an invalid expression. However, if we parse it using the foldl_start_with_parser-based parser presented earlier (sum_parser3), it accepts the input and the result is 48. This is because foldl_start_with_parser parses the input as long as it can. It parses the firstint_token (11) and then it starts parsing the plus_int elements (+ 13, + 3, + 21). After parsing all of these, it tries to parse the remaining \" +\" input using plus_int which fails and therefore foldl_start_with_parser stops after + 21.\n\nThe problem is that the parser parses the longest sub-expression starting from the beginning, that represents a valid expression. The rest is ignored. The parser can be wrapped by entire_input to make sure to reject expressions with invalid extra characters at the end, however, that won't make the error message useful. (entire_input can only tell the author of the invalid expression that after + 21 is something wrong).\n\nMetaparse provides foldl_reject_incomplete_start_with_parser, which does the same as foldl_start_with_parser, except that once no further repetitions are found, it checks where the repeated parser (in our example plus_int) fails. When it can make any progress (eg. it finds a + symbol), then foldl_reject_incomplete_start_with_parser assumes, that the expression's author intended to make the repetition longer, but made a mistake and propagates the error message coming from that last broken expression.\n\nThe above diagram shows how foldl_reject_incomplete_start_with_parser parses the example invalid input and how it fails. This can be used for better error reporting from the parsers.\n\nOther folding parsers also have their f version. (eg. foldr_reject_incomplete, foldl_reject_incomplete1, etc).\n\nAs you might have noticed, there are a lot of different folding parser combinators. To help you find the right one, the following naming convention is used:\n\n[Note] Note\n\nNote that there is no foldr_reject_incomplete_start_with_parser. The p version of the right-folding parsers applies the special parser, whose result is the initial value, after the repeated elements. Therefore, when the parser parsing one repeated element fails, foldr_start_with_parser would apply that special final parser instead of checking how the repeated element's parser failed.\n\nParsers built using Metaparse are template metaprograms parsing text (or code) at compile-time. Here is a list of things that can be the \"result\" of parsing:\n\n  \u2022 A type. An example for this is a parser parsing a printf format string and returning the typelist (eg. boost::mpl::vector) of the expected arguments.\n  \u2022 A constant value. An example for this is the result of a calculator language. See the Getting Started section for further details.\n  \u2022 A runtime object. A static runtime object can be generated that might be used at runtime. An example for this is parsing regular expressions at compile-time and building boost::xpressive::sregex objects. See the regex example of Metaparse for an example.\n  \u2022 A C++ function, which might be called at runtime. A C++ function can be generated that can be called at runtime. It is good for generating native (and optimised) code from EDSLs. See the compile_to_native_code example of Metaparse as an example for this.\n  \u2022 A template metafunction class. The result of parsing might be a type, which is a template metafunction class. This is good for building an EDSL for template metaprogramming. See the meta_hs example of Metaparse as an example for this.\n\nMetaparse provides a way to define grammars in a syntax that resembles EBNF. The grammar template can be used to define a grammar. It can be used the following way:\n\n  ::import<BOOST_METAPARSE_STRING(\"int_token\"), token<int_>>::type\n\n  ::rule<BOOST_METAPARSE_STRING(\"ws ::= (' ' | '\\n' | '\\r' | '\\t')*\")>::type\n  ::rule<BOOST_METAPARSE_STRING(\"plus_token ::= '+' ws\"), front<_1>>::type\n  ::rule<BOOST_METAPARSE_STRING(\"plus_exp ::= int_token (plus_token int_token)*\"), plus_action>::type\n\nThe code above defines a parser from a grammar definition. The start symbol of the grammar is plus_exp. The lines beginning with ::rule define rules. Rules optionally have a semantic action, which is a metafunction class that transforms the result of parsing after the rule has been applied. Existing parsers can be bound to names and be used in the rules by importing them. Lines beginning with ::import bind existing parsers to names.\n\nThe result of a grammar definition is a parser which can be given to other parser combinators or be used directly. Given that grammars can import existing parsers and build new ones, they are parser combinators as well.\n\nMetaparse is based on template metaprogramming, however, C++11 provides constexpr, which can be used for parsing at compile-time as well. While implementing parsers based on constexpr is easier for a C++ developer, since its syntax resembles the regular syntax of the language, the result of parsing has to be a constexpr value. Parsers based on template metaprogramming can build types as the result of parsing. These types may be boxed constexpr values but can be metafunction classes, classes with static functions which can be called at runtime, etc.\n\nWhen a parser built with Metaparse needs a sub-parser for processing a part of the input text and generating a constexpr value as the result of parsing, one can implement the sub-parser based on constexpr functions. Metaparse can be integrated with them and lift their results into C++ template metaprogramming. An example demonstrating this feature can be found among the examples (constexpr_parser). This capability makes it possible to integrate Metaparse with parsing libraries based on constexpr.\n\nIt is possible to write parsers for context free grammars using Metaparse. However, this is not the most general category of grammars that can be used. As Metaparse is a highly extendable framework, it is not clear what should be considered to be the limit of Metaparse itself. For example Metaparse provides the accept_when parser combinator. It can be used to provide arbitrary predicates for enabled/disabling a specific rule. One can go as far as providing the Turing machine (as a metafunction) of the entire grammar as a predicate, so one can build parsers for unrestricted grammars that can be parsed using a Turing machine. Note that such a parser would not be considered to be a parser built with Metaparse, however, it is not clear how far a solution might go and still be considered using Metaparse.\n\nMetaparse assumes that the parsers are deterministic, as they have only \"one\" result. It is of course possible to write parsers and combinators that return a set (or list or some other container) of results as that \"one\" result, but that can be considered building a new parser library. There is no clear boundary for Metaparse.\n\nMetaparse supports building top-down parsers and left-recursion is not supported as it would lead to infinite recursion.

    "\n\n\nImage : \u201cLobes of the brain NL\u201d by Henry Gray . License: Public Domain\n\nLanguage Centers of the Telencephalon\n\nThe language centers of the telencephalon include the Broca area (Brodmann area 44) and the Wernicke area (Brodmann area 22). The Broca area is located in the area of the inferior frontal gyrus of the frontal lobe, and the Wernicke area is located in the center of the temporal lobe\n\nNote: Both language centers are located only on the language-dominant hemisphere.\nBroca's and Wernicke's areas\n\nImage: Brocas and Wernicke\u2019s areas, Connexions Web site, by OpenStax College. License: CC BY 3.0\n\nFunction of the Broca\u2019s Area\n\nThe Broca area is also referred to as the motor speech center because it governs the articulation of words and sounds. Studies suggest that, apart from language production, it is also associated with action processing and the sequencing of motor actions associated with verbal and nonverbal communication. Syntax is formed in the Broca area. Furthermore, the Broca area also manages the repetition of words via afferents from the secondary auditory cortex, which is located in the area of the temporal lobe and runs around the primary auditory cortex in the form of a horseshoe. The fibers of the secondary auditory cortex and the fibers of the secondary visual cortex reach the Broca area.\n\nFunction of the Wernicke\u2019s area\n\nThe Wernicke area is also called the sensory speech area because it is responsible for the understanding of words, sentences, and requests. This area controls the process of phonologic retrieval, which is the process of sequencing the sounds of words before they are uttered. The arcuate fasciculus provides a connection between the Wernicke area and the Broca area.\n\nNote: The Wernicke area is essential for speech comprehension.\n\nSpeech Disorders due to the Failure of a Language Centre (Aphasia)\n\nDepending on which language center is affected, the symptoms of aphasia may vary. A common cause for aphasia is stroke, which in most cases (approximately 80%) is caused by ischemia.\n\nAphasia is defined as an acquired language disorder, and the cause of aphasia is centrally located. Language disorders must be distinguished from speech disorders (dysarthria), which have a variety of causes, such as cerebellar, bulbar, or extrapyramidal damage. The main forms of aphasia include Broca, Wernicke, amnesic, and global aphasia.\n\nDefinition and Symptoms of Broca\u2019s Aphasia (Motor Aphasia)\n\nBroca aphasia is caused by damage to the Broca area in the language-dominant hemisphere; it is also known as motor aphasia. It is characterized by a disturbance of the fluency of speech, which is slowed down considerably.\n\nPatients usually speak only on request, and their speech is fragmented or telegram-like. They often speak in short, fragmented sentences that make sense but are uttered with great strain. Small words are often omitted. Patients with Broca aphasia may have weakness or paralysis of the right side of the body. However, patients can easily comprehend others\u2019 speech.\n\nIn addition, phonemic paraphasia (discussed in the next section) can occur. Comprehension is hardly affected, but patients might have difficulty understanding long sentences and subordinate clauses. In some cases, reading, writing, and arithmetic abilities are also affected (alexia, agraphia, and acalculia).\n\nDefinition and Symptoms of Wernicke\u2019s Aphasia (Sensory Aphasia)\n\nWernicke aphasia is also known as sensory aphasia. It is caused by damage to the temporal lobe within the area supplied by the posterior temporal artery.\n\nThe main symptoms of Wernicke aphasia are an increased output of speech (logorrhea) and phonemic and semantic paraphasias. A patient with phonemic paraphasia has trouble with the phenomic retrieval process and confuses syllables, changes the order of syllables, or shortens words, whereas a patient with semantic paraphasia confuses entire words. The confused words often come from the same subject areafor example, substituting \u2018arm\u2019 for \u2018leg\u2019.\n\nThe increased speech output involves, among other things, making up new words (neologisms). In contrast to Broca aphasia, speech comprehension is disturbed, which additionally complicates the patient\u2019s ability to communicate. Writing and reading are usually disturbed as well.\n\nDefinition and Symptoms of Global Aphasia\n\nIn global aphasia, both the Wernicke and Broca areas are affected, as is the basal ganglia region. This results in a complete loss of speech. Patients express themselves only through sounds and, possibly, isolated words like \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019. Patients can barely understand spoken language, and they cannot write or read. However, intellectual and cognitive abilities are preserved. This form of aphasia is mainly caused by an extensive media infarction of the language-dominant hemisphere due to stroke or brain trauma. If the basal ganglia are also affected, additional unilateral symptoms, such as a form of hemiparesis, can frequently be observed as well.\n\nThis is the most severe type of aphasia, and the chances of improvement depend on the damage caused to the brain. If the damage is not very extensive, improvement may occur in 5 to 6 months; otherwise, long-term disability may remain.\n\nDefinition and Symptoms of Amnesic Aphasia\n\nIn patients with amnesic aphasia, there is not one single damaged area but, rather, multiple smaller lesions in the area of the temporal and parietal lobes of the language-dominant hemisphere.\n\nClinical presentation of amnesic aphasia involves significant word-finding problems, for which patients may try to compensate with phrases and circumlocutions. The spontaneous flow of speech, however, is not affected.\n\nOther Symptoms Associated with Damage to the Dominant Hemisphere\n\nIn addition to the forms of aphasia described, damage to the dominant hemisphere may lead to other clinical signs, such as apraxia or agnosia.\n\nDefinition of Apraxia\n\nApraxia describes the inability to adapt behavior to specific purposes and situations. Based on clinical appearance, multiple manifestations can be distinguished, including ideomotor and ideational apraxia. Individuals with ideomotor apraxia have damage in the Wernicke area and the primary motor cortex, whereas those with ideational apraxia have damage in the area of the temporoparietal junction.\n\nClinical presentation of ideomotor apraxia includes a distortion of aiming movements, movement sequences, facial expressions, and gestures. Patients with ideational apraxia are able to perform individual movements correctly but cannot implement them in a more complex sequence.\n\nDefinition of Agnosia\n\nAgnosia makes it impossible to recognize certain things, despite intact senses. Different forms of agnosia are distinguished by what types of things cannot be perceived. One form of agnosia is visual agnosia, where patients cannot recognize an object despite intact vision. When touching the same object, however, they can easily name it.\n\nFurther examples include prosopagnosia, which describes the inability to recognize people and their faces; autotopagnosia, which is characterized by the inability to localize parts of the body; and anosognosia, which describes the inability to perceive one\u2019s own body ailments or neurologic dysfunctions. Patients with anosognosia, for instance, cannot recognize hemiparesis.\u00a0\n\nOther Symptoms Associated with Damage to the Non-Dominant Hemisphere\n\nDamages to the nondominant hemisphere can cause, among other things, the so-called neglect syndrome.\n\nDefinition of Neglect Syndrome\n\nAllochiria ClockNeglect is a motor or sensory inattention to one half of the body. Unilateral neglect can be detected with the clock-drawing test, in which a patient is asked to draw a clock face with the clock hands pointing to a certain time. Most patients who have a unilateral neglect will draw all of the numbers in one half of the clock.\n\nStructure of the Limbic System\n\nThe limbic system consists of several components. These are the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus with entorhinal cortex (see above), cingulate gyrus, amygdala, and mammillary bodies.\n\nImage: \u201cIllustration from Anatomy & Physiology\u201d by OpenStax College. License: CC BY 3.0\n\nImage: The limbic lobe, by OpenStax College. License: CC BY 3.0\n\nFunction of the Limbic System\n\nThe limbic system serves a variety of functions. These include the following:\n\n  \u2022 Social cognition\n  \u2022 Control of emotions like fear, rage, and tranquility\n  \u2022 Memory\n  \u2022 Processing of olfactory senses\n  \u2022 Sexual behavior\n  \u2022 Control of appetite and eating patterns\n  \u2022 Sleep and dreams (processing unconscious emotions and conscious thoughts and forming the base of dreams)\n  \u2022 Control of addiction and motivation pathways\u00a0\n  \u2022 Control of autonomic and endocrinal response to emotions\n\nAmong other functions, the limbic system is responsible for the development of affective and instinctive behavior, sexual functions, and the formation of memory contents. However, the limbic system is not the only system involved with these functions; rather, they result from an interaction of several brain areas.\u00a0\n\nThe individual structures of the limbic system can be assigned to specific functions. The hippocampus, for instance, is the primary site of memory formation; in addition, behavior, awareness, and motivation originate here.\n\nAlongside the hippocampus, the other components of the Papez circuit are involved in memory formation. These include, for example, the mammillary bodies of the limbic system, which also mediate affective and sexual behavior.\n\nModulation of the autonomic system and development of motivation, among other things, take place in the cingulate gyrus.\n\nThe amygdala, which is located in the temporal lobe below the caudate nucleus, plays an important role in the development of behaviors and the storage of memory contents associated with emotions. The most relevant emotion here is the feeling of fear. Therefore, the amygdala is sometimes referred to as the \u2018fear center.\u2019 If there is damage in the area of the amygdala, it may cause misjudgment of a dangerous situation and, as a result, risky behavior.\n\nIn addition, the amygdala is involved in the modulation of autonomic hypothalamic areas, which may lead to, for example, an accelerated heart rate in scary situations.\n\nStructure of the Basal Ganglia\n\nThe basal ganglia, which are also known as basal nuclei, include the caudate nucleus, putamen, and globus pallidus. They are present in pairs, one on each of the two hemispheres. An evolutionary particularity of the globus pallidus is that it developed in the diencephalon but shifted to the telencephalon.\n\nbasal ganglia\n\nImage: Frontal section basal nuclei, by Phil treasure. License: CC BY 4.0\n\nTopography of the Basal Ganglia\n\nTelencephalon Horiconatal\n\nThe basal ganglia are part of the gray matter of the telencephalon and are located inside it.\n\nOn a cross-section of the brain, the head of the caudate nucleus (caput nuclei caudati) is located laterally on both sides of the anterior cornu of the lateral ventricles. The tail of the caudate nucleus (cauda nuclei caudati) lies above the posterior cornu of the lateral ventricle. The putamen and globus pallidus are located lateral to the thalamus, with the globus pallidus being more medial.\u00a0\n\nThe internal capsule runs between the thalamus and the caput nuclei caudati as the medial border and the globus pallidus and putamen as the lateral border. The white matter of the internal capsule separates the nucleus caudatus from the putamen and creates a striped appearance, which led to the name \u2018corpus striatum\u2019 for the caudate nucleus and putamen.\n\n\nThe corpus striatum is especially well defined in the frontal section. Here, the close relationship of the nucleus caudatus and the ventriculus lateralis becomes apparent. Cranially, the lateral ventricle is adjacent to the corpus callosum. Lateral to the putamen is the capsula externa and the claustrum, which is believed to be involved in sexual arousal.\n\nFunction of the Basal Ganglia\n\nThe basal ganglia are part of the extrapyramidal motor system, modulating the effect of voluntary fine motor movements.\n\nProjections of the Basal Ganglia\n\nThe projections of the basal ganglia that mediate motor information run in a loop, which is called a basal ganglia circuit, or motor circuit. Within this circuit, information is transported from the basal ganglia to the premotor cortex of the telencephalon. This information then returns from the primary motor cortex of the telencephalon to the basal ganglia.\n\nThe feedback of the information is carried out by the thalamus. In addition to the thalamus and the basal ganglia, the subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra also form part of the basal ganglia circuit.\n\nDirect pathway\n\nImage: Direct pathway,\u00a0by Lecturio\n\nIn the basal ganglia circuit, there is a direct pathway and an indirect pathway:\n\n  \u2022 In the direct pathway, the putamen projects to the globus pallidus internus and to the reticular part of the substantia nigra. Because of the transmitter \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the putamen has an inhibiting effect on the 2 mentioned projection areas. This eliminates the inhibitory effects of the globus pallidus and substantia nigra to the thalamus, and therefore the latter can act in an excitatory manner on the motor cortex.\u00a0\n  \u2022 In the indirect pathway, the putamen has an inhibitory effect on the globus pallidus externus, which usually has an inhibitory effect on the subthalamic nucleus. By eliminating this inhibitory effect, the subthalamic nucleus acts with the transmitter glutamate in an excitatory manner on the globus pallidus externus, the globus pallidus internus, and the reticular part of the substantia nigra. The reticular part of the substantia nigra and the globus pallidus internus act as inhibitors on the thalamus so that it does not promote any motor movement.\u00a0\n\nIn summary, the direct pathway acts in an excitatory manner and the indirect pathway in an inhibitory manner on the execution of movements.\n\nBasal nuclei connections\n\nImage: Basal nuclei connections, by Phil Schatz. License: CC BY 4.0\n\nDiseases Associated with the Basal Ganglia\n\nBased on their symptoms, diseases of the basal ganglia can be differentiated into hyperkinetic and hypokinetic disorders. The hyperkinetic disorders include Huntington disease and hemiballismus; the best known of the hypokinetic forms is Parkinson\u2019s disease.\n\nParkinson\u2019s Disease\n\nParkinson\u2019s disease shows damage in the area of the pars compacta of the substantia nigra. Death of dopamine-generating neurons occurs, which leads to an interruption of the inhibitory effect of the substantia nigra on the direct pathway of the basal ganglia circuit. Because of this disinhibition, the indirect pathway becomes more active and inhibits the thalamus, which leads to a reduction in movement.\n\n\nParkinson\u2019s disease is a movement disorder caused by an insufficient amount of dopamine, a chemical produced by the neurons.\n\nClinical features\n\nParkinson\u2019s disease is characterized by a typical clinical triad consisting of akinesia, rigidity, and tremor. Sometimes, postural instability is included with the main symptoms as well. The tremor is typically a resting tremor that begins mostly on one side (i.e. it is asymmetric). Poor balance and coordination are marked.\n\nThe patient\u2019s gait pattern provides a first indication of the disease. As part of hypokinesia or akinesia, the gait is characterized by short steps and a forward inflection (propulsion) with a reduced swinging of the arms, which is often more pronounced on one side as well. As the disease progresses, other symptoms appear, such as sleep disorders; depression; and difficulty chewing, swallowing, and speaking.\n\nSymptoms are:\n\n  \u2022 Bradykinesia or akinesia\n  \u2022 Rigidity\n  \u2022 Resting tremor of the hands and fingers\n  \u2022 Difficulty initiating movements\n  \u2022 Movements that are abnormally slow\n  \u2022 Decreased facial expression\n\nStructural changes and causes:\n\n  \u2022 Depigmentation of the substantia nigra\n  \u2022 Lewy bodies\n  \u2022 Causes include genetics, environment, certain medications, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), and vascular insult\n\n\nDiagnosis is made on the basis of clinical presentation, history, and neurologic examination.\n\n\nThe treatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease involves different classes of drugs. These include anticholinergics, levodopa, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, dopamine agonists, monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitors, or catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors.\n\nRecommendations for the initiation of therapy depend on the age of the patient. For patients younger than 70 years, initiation of therapy with a dopamine agonist is recommended; for patients 70 years and older, L-DOPA (levodopa) is recommended. However, the treatment regimen has to be individually adjusted for each patient in accordance with his or her dominant symptoms.\n\nHuntington\u2019s Disease (Chorea)\n\n\nHuntington disease involves atrophic lesions in the area of the basal ganglia, corpus striatum, and, in a later stage of the disease, cerebral cortex. The disease shows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern and generally manifests in the third to fifth decades of life.\n\nPathophysiology/Clinical Features\n\nIn Huntington disease, there is a decrease in GABA concentration due to atrophy of the corpus striatum, and this leads to an imbalance between GABA and dopamine. Dopamine acts in support of the direct pathway and inhibits the indirect pathway of the basal ganglia circuit, which leads to increased activation of the thalamus and the motor cortex.\n\nThe resulting spontaneous movements are noticeable, primarily in the face and distal extremities. These repeated movements lead to increased caloric consumption, and patients often present as cachectic. Food intake is even more difficult when the caudal cranial nerve is affected and the chewing and tongue muscles are impaired.\n\nExtrapyramidal movement disorder often follows previous psychopathologic changes, which can manifest 10\u201315 years before in the form of disturbed motivation and emotion or psychosis. In the course of Huntington disease, the development of dementia is rather common.\n\nSymptoms are:\n\n  \u2022 Chorea\n  \u2022 Athetosis\n  \u2022 Personality changes\n  \u2022 Dementia\n\nStructural changes and causes:\n\n  \u2022 Loss of GABAergic, medium size, spiny neurons from striatum\n  \u2022 Ventricular enlargement\n  \u2022 Genetic cause\u00a0\u2013 autosomal dominant\n  \u2022 Excessive CGA repeats\n\n\nThe progression of the disease cannot be influenced therapeutically; that is, there is no way to treat the cause. However, symptoms can be treated with medication, physiotherapy, and ergotherapy. For example, sulpiride can be used to treat hyperkinesia.\n\n\nHemiballismus is usually caused by damage in the area of the subthalamic nucleus. Clinical signs of hemiballismus include suddenly emerging proximal flinging movements.\n\nThere is no known cure. Treatment approaches include drugs such as neuroleptics, valproic acid, and, sometimes, benzodiazepines.\n\nFibre System of the Telencephalon\n\nfibre system of the telencephalon\n\nImage: Coronal T2 (greyscale inverted) MRI of the brain at the level of the caudate nuclei emphasizing corpus callosum. By Frank Gaillard. License: CC BY-SA 3.0\n\nThe fibers of the telencephalon are divided into 3 classes, depending on their function: the commissural, association, and projection fibers.\n\nThe commissural fibers connect certain areas of both hemispheres with one another, thus enabling an exchange between them. The majority of commissural fibers are located in the corpus callosum, which also connects the 2 hemispheres anatomically.\n\nIn contrast to the commissural fibers, the association fibers connect individual parts of the same hemisphere.\n\nProjection fibers connect the cortex with the subcortical areas, including the thalamus and the basal ganglia. The majority of these fibers run through the internal capsule and the external capsule.\n\nStructure of the Internal Capsule\n\nThe internal capsule is divided into 3 sections: the crus anterius (anterior limb), the crus posterius (posterior limb), and the genu (bend). Specific tracts project through each section, which are also organized somatotopically.\n\nThe frontopontine tract and the anterior thalamic peduncle run through the crus anterius. In the genu of the internal capsule, there are parts of the tracts of the dorsal thalamic peduncle; the remaining parts of these tracts pass through the crus posterius. In addition, the crus posterius contains the fibrae corticonuclearis, fibrae corticospinalis, tractus temporopontinus, and radiatio optica.\n\nSomatotopy of the Internal Capsule\n\nNote: The corticospinal fibers are arranged somatotopically in the crus posterius of the internal capsule.\n\nFunction of a Commissurotomy (split-brain)\n\nThe separation of the commissural fibers within the corpus callosum is called commissurotomy. This interrupts the communication between the 2 hemispheres. This surgical intervention is used in epilepsy treatment as a last resort. The complete sectioning of the corpus callosum prevents generalization, that is, the propagation of an epileptic seizure to both hemispheres.\n\nLearn. Apply.

    "RDBMS Placement Question and Answers\n\n1. What is RDBMS?\n\n\n2. What are the properties of the Relational tables?\n\nRelational tables have six properties:\n\n  1. Values are atomic.\n  2. Column values are of the same kind.\n  3. Each row is unique.\n  4. The sequence of columns is insignificant.\n  5. The sequence of rows is insignificant.\n  6. Each column must have a unique name.\n\n3. What is Normalization?\n\n\n4. What is De-normalization?\n\nDe-normalization is the process of attempting to optimize the performance of a database by adding redundant data. It is sometimes necessary because current DBMSs implement the relational model poorly. A true relational DBMS would allow for a fully normalized database at the logical level, while providing physical storage of data that is tuned for high performance. De-normalization is a technique to move from higher to lower normal forms of database modeling in order to speed up database access.\n\n5. What are different normalization forms?\n\n  1. 1NF: Eliminate Repeating Groups Make a separate table for each set of related attributes, and give each table a primary key. Each field contains at most one value from its attribute domain.\n  2. 2NF: Eliminate Redundant Data If an attribute depends on only part of a multi-valued key, remove it to a separate table.\n  3. 3NF: Eliminate Columns Not Dependent On Key If attributes do not contribute to a description of the key, remove them to a separate table. All attributes must be directly dependent on the primary key.\n  4. BCNF: Boyce-Codd Normal Form If there are non-trivial dependencies between candidate key attributes, separate them out into distinct tables.\n  5. 4NF: Isolate Independent Multiple Relationships No table may contain two or more 1:n or n:m relationships that are not directly related.\n  6. 5NF: Isolate Semantically Related Multiple Relationships There may be practical constrains on information that justify separating logically related many-to-many relationships.\n  7. ONF: Optimal Normal Form A model limited to only simple (elemental) facts, as expressed in Object Role Model notation.\n  8. DKNF: Domain-Key Normal Form A model free from all modification anomalies is said to be in DKNF.\n\nRemember, these normalization guidelines are cumulative. For a database to be in 3NF, it must first fulfill all the criteria of a 2NF and 1NF database.\n\n6. What is Stored Procedure?\n\n\ne.g. sp_helpdb, sp_renamedb, sp_depends etc.\n\n7. What is Trigger?\n\nA trigger is a SQL procedure that initiates an action when an event (INSERT, DELETE or UPDATE) occurs. Triggers are stored in and managed by the DBMS. Triggers are used to maintain the referential integrity of data by changing the data in a systematic fashion. A trigger cannot be called or executed; DBMS automatically fires the trigger as a result of a data modification to the associated table. Triggers can be viewed as similar to stored procedures in that both consist of procedural logic that is stored at the database level. Stored procedures, however, are not event-drive and are not attached to a specific table as triggers are. Stored procedures are explicitly executed by invoking a CALL to the procedure while triggers are implicitly executed. In addition, triggers can also execute stored procedures.\n\n8. What is Nested Trigger?\n\nA trigger can also contain INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE logic within itself, so when the trigger is fired because of data modification it can also cause another data modification, thereby firing another trigger. A trigger that contains data modification logic within itself is called a nested trigger.\n\n9. What is View?\n\nA simple view can be thought of as a subset of a table. It can be used for retrieving data, as well as updating or deleting rows. Rows updated or deleted in the view are updated or deleted in the table the view was created with. It should also be noted that as data in the original table changes, so does data in the view, as views are the way to look at part of the original table. The results of using a view are not permanently stored in the database. The data accessed through a view is actually constructed using standard T-SQL select command and can come from one to many different base tables or even other views.\n\n10. What is Index?\n\n\n11. What is a Linked Server?\n\n\n12. What is Cursor?\n\n\nIn order to work with a cursor we need to perform some steps in the following order:\n\n  1. Declare cursor\n  2. Open cursor\n  3. Fetch row from the cursor\n  4. Process fetched row\n\nClose cursor13. What is Collation?\n\nCollation refers to a set of rules that determine how data is sorted and compared. Character data is sorted using rules that define the correct character sequence, with options for specifying case sensitivity, accent marks, kana character types and character width.\n\n14. What is Difference between Function and Stored Procedure?\n\nUDF can be used in the SQL statements anywhere in the WHERE/HAVING/SELECT section where as Stored procedures cannot be. UDFs that return tables can be treated as another rowset. This can be used in JOINs with other tables. Inline UDF\u2019s can be thought of as views that take parameters and can be used in JOINs and other Rowset operations.\n\n15. What is sub-query? Explain properties of sub-query?\n\nSub-queries are often referred to as sub-selects, as they allow a SELECT statement to be executed arbitrarily within the body of another SQL statement. A sub-query is executed by enclosing it in a set of parentheses. Sub-queries are generally used to return a single row as an atomic value, though they may be used to compare values against multiple rows with the IN keyword.\n\nA subquery is a SELECT statement that is nested within another T-SQL statement. A subquery SELECT statement if executed independently of the T-SQL statement, in which it is nested, will return a resultset. Meaning a subquery SELECT statement can standalone and is not depended on the statement in which it is nested. A subquery SELECT statement can return any number of values, and can be found in, the column list of a SELECT statement, a FROM, GROUP BY, HAVING, and/or ORDER BY clauses of a T-SQL statement. A Subquery can also be used as a parameter to a function call. Basically a subquery can be used anywhere an expression can be used.\n\n16. What are different Types of Join?\n\n    1. Left Outer Join: In Left Outer Join all rows in the first-named table i.e. \u201cleft\u201d table, which appears leftmost in the JOIN clause are included. Unmatched rows in the right table do not appear.\n    2. Right Outer Join: In Right Outer Join all rows in the second-named table i.e. \u201cright\u201d table, which appears rightmost in the JOIN clause are included. Unmatched rows in the left table are not included.\n\n17. What are primary keys and foreign keys?\n\nPrimary keys are the unique identifiers for each row. They must contain unique values and cannot be null. Due to their importance in relational databases, Primary keys are the most fundamental of all keys and constraints. A table can have only one Primary key. Foreign keys are both a method of ensuring data integrity and a manifestation of the relationship between tables.\n\n18. What is User Defined Functions? What kind of User-Defined Functions can be created?\n\nUser-Defined Functions allow defining its own T-SQL functions that can accept 0 or more parameters and return a single scalar data value or a table data type.\nDifferent Kinds of User-Defined Functions created are:\n\n  3. Multi-statement Table-Value User-Defined Function A Multi-Statement Table-Value user-defined function returns a table and is also an exceptional alternative to a view as the function can support multiple T-SQL statements to build the final result where the view is limited to a single SELECT statement. Also, the ability to pass parameters into a TSQL select command or a group of them gives us the capability to in essence create a parameterized, non-updateable view of the data in the underlying tables. Within the create function command you must define the table structure that is being returned. After creating this type of user-defined function, It can be used in the FROM clause of a T-SQL command unlike the behavior found when using a stored procedure which can also return record sets.\n  1. Deallocate cursor\n\n19. What is Identity?\n\nIdentity (or AutoNumber) is a column that automatically generates numeric values. A start and increment value can be set, but most DBA leave these at 1. A GUID column also generates numbers; the value of this cannot be controlled. Identity/GUID columns do not need to be indexed.\n\n20. What is DataWarehousing?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA table can have one of the following index configurations:\n\n  1. No indexes\n  2. A clustered index\n  3. A clustered index and many nonclustered indexes\n  4. A nonclustered index\n  5. Many nonclustered indexes\n\n4. What are different types of Collation Sensitivity?\n\n  1. Case sensitivity \u2013 A and a, B and b, etc.\n  2. Accent sensitivity\n  3. Kana Sensitivity \u2013 When Japanese kana characters Hiragana and Katakana are treated differently, it is called Kana sensitive.\n\n5. What is OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)?\n\n\n6. What\u2019s the difference between a primary key and a unique key?\n\n\n7. What is difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE commands?\n\n\n    2. TRUNCATE removes the data by deallocating the data pages used to store the table\u2019s data, and only the page deallocations are recorded in the transaction log.\n    5. TRUNCATE cannot be rolled back.\n    6. TRUNCATE is DDL Command.\n    7. TRUNCATE Resets identity of the table\n  2. DELETE:\n    3. DELETE Can be used with or without a WHERE clause\n    4. DELETE Activates Triggers.\n    5. DELETE can be rolled back.\n    6. DELETE is DML Command.\n    7. DELETE does not reset identity of the table.\n\nNote: DELETE and TRUNCATE both can be rolled back when surrounded by TRANSACTION if the current session is not closed. If TRUNCATE is written in Query Editor surrounded by TRANSACTION and if session is closed, it can not be rolled back but DELETE can be rolled back.\n\n8. When is the use of UPDATE_STATISTICS command?\n\n\n\n\n\n  1. Properties of Sub-Query\n  2. Types of Sub-Query\n\n11. What is SQL Profiler?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14. What is SQL Server Agent?\n\n\n\n\n16. What is Log Shipping?\n\n\n\nSELECT * FROM table1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21. What is PRIMARY KEY?\n\n\n22. What is UNIQUE KEY constraint?\n\n\n23. What is FOREIGN KEY?\n\n\n24. What is CHECK Constraint?\n\nA CHECK constraint is used to limit the values that can be placed in a column. The check constraints are used to enforce domain integrity. 25. What is NOT NULL Constraint?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n28. What are the advantages of using Stored Procedures?\n\n  2. Stored procedure execution plans can be reused, staying cached in SQL Server\u2019s memory, reducing server overhead.\n  3. Stored procedures help promote code reuse.\n  5. Stored procedures provide better security to your data.\n\n\n\n30. Can SQL Servers linked to other servers like Oracle?\n\n\n31. What is BCP? When does it used?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. What are the basic functions for master, msdb, model, tempdb and resource databases?\n\n  1. The master database holds information for all databases located on the SQL Server instance and is theglue that holds the engine together. Because SQL Server cannot start without a functioning masterdatabase, you must administer this database with care.\n  3. The tempdb holds temporary objects such as global and local temporary tables and stored procedures.\n  5. The resoure Database is a read-only database that contains all the system objects that are included with SQL Server. SQL Server system objects, such as sys.objects, are physically persisted in the Resource database, but they logically appear in the sys schema of every database. The Resource database does not contain user data or user metadata.\n\n2. What is Service Broker?\n\nService Broker is a message-queuing technology in SQL Server that allows developers to integrate SQL Server fully into distributed applications. Service Broker is feature which provides facility to SQL Server to send an asynchronous, transactional message. it allows a database to send a message to another database without waiting for the response, so the application will continue to function if the remote database is temporarily unavailable.\n\n3. Where SQL server user names and passwords are stored in SQL server?\n\nThey get stored in System Catalog Views sys.server_principals and sys.sql_logins.\n\n4. What is Policy Management?\n\n\n5. What is Replication and Database Mirroring?\n\n\n6. What are Sparse Columns?\n\n\n7. What does TOP Operator Do?\n\n\n8. What is CTE?\n\n\n9. What is MERGE Statement?\n\nMERGE is a new feature that provides an efficient way to perform multiple DML operations. In previous versions of SQL Server, we had to write separate statements to INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE data based on certain conditions, but now, using MERGE statement we can include the logic of such data modifications in one statement that even checks when the data is matched then just update it and when unmatched then insert it. One of the most important advantages of MERGE statement is all the data is read and processed only once.\n\n10. What is Filtered Index?\n\nFiltered Index is used to index a portion of rows in a table that means it applies filter on INDEX which improves query performance, reduce index maintenance costs, and reduce index storage costs compared with full-table indexes. When we see an Index created with some where clause then that is actually a FILTERED INDEX.\n\n11. Which are new data types introduced in SQL SERVER 2008?\n\n  1. The GEOMETRY Type: The GEOMETRY data type is a system .NET common language runtime (CLR) data type in SQL Server. This type represents data in a two-dimensional Euclidean coordinate system.\n  3. New Date and Time Datatypes:SQL Server 2008 introduces four new datatypes related to date and time: DATE, TIME, DATETIMEOFFSET, and DATETIME2.\n    1. DATE: The new DATE type just stores the date itself. It is based on the Gregorian calendar and handles years from 1 to 9999.\n    3. The DATETIMEOFFSET Type: DATETIMEOFFSET (n) is the time-zone-aware version of a datetime datatype. The name will appear less odd when you consider what it really is: a date + a time + a time-zone offset. The offset is based on how far behind or ahead you are from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) time.\n    4. The DATETIME2 Type: It is an extension of the datetime type in earlier versions of SQL Server. This new datatype has a date range covering dates from January 1 of year 1 through December 31 of year 9999. This is a definite improvement over the 1753 lower boundary of the datetime datatype. DATETIME2 not only includes the larger date range, but also has a timestamp and the same fractional precision that TIME type provides\n\n12. What are the Advantages of using CTE?\n\n  1. Using CTE improves the readability and makes maintenance of complex queries easy.\n  2. The query can be divided into separate, simple, logical building blocks which can be then used to build more complex CTEs until final result set is generated.\n  3. CTE can be defined in functions, stored procedures, triggers or even views.\n  4. After a CTE is defined, it can be used as a Table or a View and can SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE Data.\n\n13. What is CLR?\n\n\n14. What are synonyms?\n\n\n15. What is LINQ?\n\n\n  1. Tools to create classes (usually called entities) mapped to database tables\n  2. Compatibility with LINQ\u2019s standard query operations\n\n16. What is Isolation Levels?\n\n\nTransaction isolation levels control:\n\n  1. Whether locks are taken when data is read, and what type of locks are requested.\n  2. How long the read locks are held.\n  3. Whether a read operation referencing rows modified by another transaction:\n    1. Blocks until the exclusive lock on the row is freed.\n    2. Retrieves the committed version of the row that existed at the time the statement or transaction started.\n    3. Reads the uncommitted data modification.\n\n17. What is use of EXCEPT Clause?\n\n\n18. How would you handle error in SQL SERVER 2008?\n\nSQL Server now supports the use of TRY\u2026CATCH con handling. TRY\u2026CATCH lets us build error handling at the level we need, in the way w to, by setting a region where if any error occurs, it will break out of the region and head to an error handler.\n\nThe basic structure is as follows:\n\n19. What is RAISEERROR?\n\n\n20. How to rebuild Master Database?\n\nMaster database is system database and it contains information about running server\u2019s configuration. When SQL Server 2005 is installed it usually creates master, model, msdb, tempdb resource and distribution system database by default. Only Master database is th one which is absolutely must have database. Without Master database SQL Server cannot be started. This is the reason it is extremely important to backup Master database.\n\n\n21. What is XML Datatype?\n\n\n22. What is Data Compression?\n\nIn SQL SERVE 2008 Data Compression comes in two flavors:\n\n  1. Row Compression: Row compression changes the format of physical storage of data. It minimize the metadata (column information, length, offsets etc) associated with each record. Numeric data types and fixed length strings are stored in variable-length storage format, just like Varchar.\n  2. Page Compression:Page compression allows common data to be shared between rows for a given page. Its uses the following techniques to compress data:\n    1. Row compression.\n    2. Prefix Compression. For every column in a page duplicate prefixes are identified. These prefixes are saved in compression information headers (CI) which resides after page header. A reference number is assigned to these prefixes and that reference number is replaced where ever those prefixes are being used.\n  3. Dictionary Compression: Dictionary compression searches for duplicate values throughout the page and stores them in CI. The main difference between prefix and dictionary compression is that prefix is only restricted to one column while dictionary is applicable to the complete page.\n\n23. What is Catalog Views?\n\nCatalog views return information that is used by the SQL Server Database Engine. Catalog Views are the most general interface to the catalog metadata and provide the most efficient way to obtain, transform, and present customized forms of this information. All user- available catalog metadata is exposed through catalog views.\n\n24. What is PIVOT and UNPIVOT?\n\nA Pivot Table can automatically sort, count, and total the data stored in one table or spreadsheet and create a second table displaying the summarized data. The PIVOT operator turns the values of a specified column into column names, effectively rotating a table.\n\nUNPIVOT table is reverse of PIVOT Table.\n\n25. What is Dirty Read ?\n\nA dirty read occurs when two operations say, read and write occurs together giving the incorrect or unedited data. Suppose, A has changed a row, but has not committed the changes. B reads the uncommitted data but his view of the data may be wrong so that is Dirty Read.\n\n26. What is Aggregate Functions?\n\nAggregate functions perform a calculation on a set of values and return a single value. Aggregate functions ignore NULL values except COUNT function. HAVING clause is used, along with GROUP BY, for filtering query using aggregate values.\n\nFollowing functions are aggregate functions.\n\n\n27. What do you mean by Table Sample?\n\nTABLESAMPLE allows you to extract a sampling of rows from a table in the FROM clause. The rows retrieved are random and they are not in any order. This sampling can be based on a percentage of number of rows. You can use TABLESAMPLE when only a sampling of rows is necessary for the application instead of a full result set.\n\n28. What is the difference between UNION and UNION ALL?\n\n  1. UNION The UNION command is used to select related information from two tables, much like the JOIN command. However, when using the UNION command all selected columns need to be of the same data type. With UNION, only distinct values are selected.\n  2. UNION ALL The UNION ALL command is equal to the UNION command, except that UNION ALL selects all values.\n\nThe difference between Union and Union all is that Union all will not eliminate duplicate rows, instead it just pulls all rows from all tables fitting your query specifics and combines them into a table.\n\n29. What is B-Tree?\n\nThe database server uses a B-tree structure to organize index information. B-Tree generally has following types of index pages or nodes:\n\n  1. root node: A root node contains node pointers to branch nodes which can be only one.\n  2. branch node: A branch node contains pointers to leaf nodes or other branch nodes which can be two or more.\n  3. leaf nodes: A leaf node contains index items and orizantal pointers to other leaf nodes which can be many.\n(Visited 8
